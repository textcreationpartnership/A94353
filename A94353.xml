            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>ch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Saints, among whom hee converſed here on earth) made it his great deſigne (the love of Chriſt conſtraining him) both by preaching and walking, to promote <hi>faith towards Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>love to all Saints.</hi> Hee lived much by faith, and was often in coming to the Father by the Son as a poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as he uſually expreſſed it.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but take the opportunity to ſay that which I apprehend, the Word of Chriſt, and alſo our experience doe witneſs,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That the Act of Faith whereby wee are looking to Jeſus, coming to him, and rowling upon him as the only way to the Father; it is indeed the great Act, it is that which doth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, and that which Chriſt doth honour as a great faith. After that poor woman of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> Mat. 15. had endured many repulſes, and yet making after Chriſt, and hanging upon
<pb facs="tcp:115823:3"/>him, he ſaith <hi>O woman, great is thy faith;</hi> this was clearly a faith of dependance.</p>
            <p n="2">2 We are extreamly averſe to this duty; There is a great deſire of evidence, &amp;c. but when we ſhould look to, and ſtay on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or rather on God in it, O what a difficult work is it! Indeed by thus beleeving, <hi>Romans</hi> 16.26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.2. we <hi>yeeld</hi> unto God the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience hee requires, without which wee cannot <hi>pleaſe</hi> him; and it is that for which the Goſpel is ſent among us; and hereby wee doe indeed act Self-denial. Is it not a great part of Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, for the Soul which doth naturally ſet up his owne righteouſneſſe, and would not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to God for his, to renounce his right, that is ſo dear to him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. Hereby alſo the Soul denies his Carnal reaſon, as <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4. hee ſacrificed his Carnal reaſon before he could enjoy or Sacrifice his <hi>Iſaac.</hi> It is no wonder that our hearts are ſo hardly brought up to ſuch actings, there is not only an inabillity to them, but enmity againſt them; as Chriſt hath told us, <hi>Yee will not come to me,</hi> Joh. 5.40.</p>
            <p n="3">3 We have no aſſurance and evidence, but in and by theſe acts of reliance; it is poſſible wee may have a true faith; and great faith of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance without evidence, — but our aſſurance comes in this way, as we have not the reflection of the Sun upon the wall, except the beames of the Sun flow forth.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Our Lord Jeſus being the Author and Finiſher, and alſo actor of our faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. (without whom wee can doe nothing) hee that worketh to will as
<pb facs="tcp:115823:3"/>well as to doe in his people, and that freely, we cannot act this faith but as we are acted by him; let us therefore expect all our fruites from him. And becauſe faith worketh by love, and the more the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts, the more faith, &amp;c. alſo the more faith the more love to God; let us look much into the Goſpel, which gives us ſo great diſcovery of that love.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Behold there with admiration, God from Eternity freely purpoſing the Salvation of the Elect in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>hee hath ſaved us, &amp;c. not according to our works, but according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and grace, which was given in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2 After we had all fallen from God, in that fearful Apoſtacy of our firſt Parents, under the Wrath and Curſe of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.2. behold, God ſending forth his dear Son, made of a Woman, &amp;c. for the redemption of poor ſinners from this woful ſtate, — and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not only delivering his people from the depth of miſery, but reſtoring them to the height of happineſſe; for by the death of our Lord Jeſus is <hi>a way</hi> made to <hi>bring</hi> us unto God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. by it <hi>we come</hi> to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. all thoſe that <hi>come</hi> to God <hi>come</hi> by him; wee <hi>come</hi> even to the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>No man cometh to the Father but by me;</hi> here is the true center of our immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſouls. Thus our dear Lord doth bring us to ſoul-reſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28, 29. O what manner of love is this!</p>
            <p n="3">3 Behold here the will of the Father and the Son, both concurring in this matter. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4.
<pb facs="tcp:115823:4"/>(which the heart of this Author was much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with.)</p>
            <p n="4">4 Here is a diſcovery of Chriſt as an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commer actually, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. It is obſerveable, that the very firſt promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. declares him a Conqueror, and all the Saints for many Ages lived upon, and were comforted in Chriſt, as hee who was to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; and though this perhaps in the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their faith, the tempter might trouble them withall; but what if their expected Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah ſhould not come? or, what if he ſhould not overcome their enemies, what would become of them then? Now there is no roome for this temptation, he hath <hi>aboliſhed death,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.10. <hi>I have overcome the world,</hi> Joh. 6.33. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Lord, <hi>Be you of good cheer,</hi> it is for you and be yee comforted by it, there is vertue and ſtrength in it for you, whereby you ſhall bee more than conquerours. And hereby may the Saints come up to that difficult Piece of Self-denial, to ſubmit to the will of God, who will have ſome remainders of corruption yet in his people, as (in theſe Sermons is mentioned, where) the Author doth caution us not ſo to ſubmit to, as not to ſtrive againſt corruptions, to mourn over them, and watch againſt them, &amp;c. but when we have done ſo, to ſubmit to his will, who will have them remaine in us; this I ſay is the way to come up to it, the looking to Chriſts victory over them. It is granted, that the ſight of Corruptions yet ſtirring in the ſoul, is matter of very bitter mourning, but not of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing; he that comes into the Field and ſeeth an
<pb facs="tcp:115823:4"/>Army of Enemies, if ſome bee ſlaine, ſome breathing out their laſt, ſome bleeding, &amp;c. hath not cauſe to deſpair, though to mourn; ſo here.</p>

            <p>IT is an Argument of unſpeakable favour, and matchleſſe condeſcention, that the God of glory would vouchſafe to enter into the band of <hi>a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> with any of the Race of ſorry Man, and therefore the clearing up the <hi>Nature of the New Covenant</hi> made with Beleevers in Chriſt (which is a great deſigne of one of theſe Treatiſes) muſt needs be of choyſe advantage to the Saints.</p>
            <p>As eſtrangement from the <hi>Covenant</hi> is a depth of miſery, <hi>Epheſ. 2.12.</hi> ſo a ſpecial experimental acquaintance with it, is a height of happineſs.</p>
            <p>When the Ark (a ſigne of the <hi>Covenant</hi>) was taken, it was ſaid of old, <hi>The glory is departed from Iſrael;</hi> but when men have this <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> with them, there are the approachings of the greateſt <hi>glory</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>He that is owned within the verge of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> hath an everlaſting hold of God himſelf, to ſuch a Soul it may bee ſaid, thy God, thy glory. Toſſed tempted Souls may finde ſupport and ſuccour here; fainting, ſinking Souls reviving; drooping, dejected Soules, refreſhment; yea when they have drawne, and ſuckt the largeſt draughts out of
<pb facs="tcp:115823:6"/>theſe breſts of Conſolation, yet they are ſtill as full as ever. It addeth abundance of ſweetneſſe to any, even the loweſt or leaſt injoyments, if they can bee diſcerned to have their conveyance in the way of the <hi>New Covenant</hi> to him that hath them, yea a froward, diſquieted, diſcontented heart will bee ſweetly bowed into a <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> unto the <hi>Will of God</hi> in the worst conditions, if it can but deſcry the face of a reconciled God through a free promiſe therein.</p>
            <p>And to help forward <hi>ſubmiſſion to the Will of God</hi> (which another of theſe Treatiſes calleth for) give us leave to adde a few words by way of direction.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1 Keep a fixed eye upon God under the ſharpeſt Diſpenſations;</hi> if thou eyeſt the Rod more than the hand that uſeth it, thou wilt manifest thy ſelf a froward Childe, under the gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt fatherly Chaſtiſements; but if thy eye be ehief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon a Divine hand which ſmiteth, thou wilt more quietly ſtoop unto it, when it carrieth with it the greateſt ſhew of enmity. Good old <hi>Eli,</hi> when ſuch ſad newes was ſent unto him, as ſhould make the ears of all that heard of it tingle, yet he keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eye upon God, <hi>1 Sam. 3.18. It is the Lord,</hi> hee freely ſubmitteth <hi>[Let him doe what ſeemeth him good.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2 Keep affections unto Chriſt very high, and to Creatures very low;</hi> heart engagements to Creature injoyments, render it double hard, to ſay Amen unto the <hi>Will of God,</hi> when ſufferings lye there; but the greater endearance of God and Chriſt to a Soul, the more eaſily will it riſe to a gracious <hi>ſubmiſſion,</hi> either in the wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb facs="tcp:115823:7"/>and denials of, or parting with earthly things, <hi>1 Corinth. 13. verſ. 4. Charity ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth long,</hi> verſ. <hi>7. beareth all things, endureth all things.</hi> As when men, ſo alſo when God and Chriſt are the Objects loved, there will be a patient <hi>bearing</hi> from their hands; things which if they came from ſuch as were not dearly loved, would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be endured. It was doleful news to the Diſciples to hear of Chriſts departure, yet ſaith hee, <hi>John 14.28. If yee loved me, yee would rejoyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſaid, I goe unto the Father,</hi> ſo that love to Chriſt (i. e. if ſtrong) will carry out to, not only a free, but cheerful <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> unto Chriſt in the hardeſt things.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3 Eye much the manifeſtations of Chriſts love and affection to you in the various expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it;</hi> there may be a recollection of many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer experiences even of the Lords working up your hearts into a ſubmiſſion unto his will in former ſtraights, yea you may look upon ſuch words or promiſes as have a natural tendency to allay ſuch diſquiet of heart as you are under, and yet theſe may but diſcover your duty, and you may feele no strength coming along there-with enabling you to riſe up unto it; but at laſt, by an eying the ſweet diſcoveries of Divine love in former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, or preſent afflictions, in affording ſo many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes of prayer, you may be powerfully engaged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a willingneſſe to doe, or ſuffer any thing that the Lord ſhall ſee it meet to exerciſe you with, that ſo you may returne love for love, <hi>Heb. 12.5, 6.

                  <p>YOurs I received, both which have been a refreſhment to my ſpirit; I much rejoyce, that there is a remnant at this day even among us, that ſympathize with the ſuffering cauſe of Chriſt, and are kept faithfull to their Lord, in this hour of temptation; although my employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſo many, that time is very precious with me, yet could I not upon the reading of yours, but make return of a few lines, for this is the day in which Saints are called to ſpeak often one to another. God is trying his people with ſuch trials, as they have never before met withall: I mean in reſpect of the wonderful difficultie of judging things and cauſes at this day; one thing hath been a ſore temptation to mee oftentimes about the Cauſe of Chriſt now, <hi>viz.</hi> the many paſſions and weakneſſes that have appeared in thoſe who now among us ſtand up for it; I know not but that it may have been the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of other ſpirits, I may ſay as to my own, it hath been the greateſt of all.</p>
                  <p>I have had many times reliefe againſt it, from ſuch like conſiderations as theſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The Mercy approaching is a great New Covenant Mercy; New Covenant Mercies call not for worthineſſe in the recipient, but are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſo ordered as to be given forth when the receiver is moſt unworthy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That it hath beene a part of Saints weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb facs="tcp:115823:8"/>in former Ages to judge of Cauſes by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, God in this day would have his people to judge of his Cauſe by his Light alone, laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the conſideration of perſons, the effect of which ordinarily is in thoſe that ſteere this courſe, a founding their faith, not in the Word or Power of God, but in the wiſdome or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 That by how much the greater the Mercy expected is, by ſo much the greater muſt the trial of faith fore-running it, be; now no trial of faith, to a truly gracious conſcientious ſoul, is greater than this.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 That in caſe ſuffering Saints in this day, (and in this Nation more eſpecially, wherein Gods remnant is great) ſhould bear forth their teſtimony, with that eminency of Grace which Saints formerly have done in an ordinary way, that ſtop which muſt be for a while to the work, for the bringing about the all-wiſe and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Counſel of God, could not have been thus long, for hereby Saints would have had their eyes open preſently, and their eyes being generally opened, ſuch is their power this day in the Nation, that in an ordinary way the wheele would turne.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The Kingdome of Chriſt could not (as it muſt) come without obſervation, if eminent marks and characters of Holineſs, were written on the faces of all thoſe that ſhould plead or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Many muſt ſtumble and fall, be ſnared and broken, and taken, and that by ſmiting againſt the ſtone, who being enlightned, would not
<pb facs="tcp:115823:9"/>dare to doe it; were not ſuch things as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Saints weakneſſes and paſſions laid before them as ſtumbling-blocks, to ſet their Natural Conſciences at liberty?</p>
                  <p n="7">7 <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdome (the Tipe of Chriſts) did ariſe, with manifeſt offence, in reſpect of its followers, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 Chriſt when hee rides as King, chuſeth a Colt to ride on, an untamed and unruly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the Colt of an Aſſe, a ſimple and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely Creature to the eye. Saints failings have hitherto been blemiſhes to the cauſe, but God is removing of them; and it is obſervable, that as late ſufferers have gone with more clearneſs into ſuffering, ſo the Lord hath made them ſenſible of thoſe things in which their brethren have gone awry.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 I call it <hi>a Frame,</hi> to note,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>The ſetledneſs of the Act,</hi> it is not a <hi>haſty ſudden motion,</hi> or reſolution, I will ſubmit to <hi>Gods Will,</hi> which ſometimes ariſeth from a preſent flaſh of conviction or affection, and dies again with that; but a <hi>ſetled habitual Principle,</hi> cauſing a Soul, whether ſenſe or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ebbe or flow, to be upon a level in this reſpect, of having its <hi>Will</hi> conformed to Gods.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>The way by which we come by it, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it;</hi> which is not ſo much by uſing force or violence, as by an orderly gentle motion; for violence breaks a <hi>frame,</hi> and puts that thing out of <hi>frame</hi> which was in <hi>frame</hi> before. In <hi>framing</hi> of a building, the way is not by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to throw things together, that produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth confuſion, and a heap, but no building; but by an orderly and gentle motion directing each thing to its proper place, a building is produced: So this <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to the <hi>Will of God</hi> is not attained, or kept by an offering violence to the <hi>Will,</hi> plucking and haling it downe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible againſt the ſtream, it ſhall <hi>ſubmit,</hi> will it,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115823:19"/>nill it; but by an orderly gentle motion bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Will about, turning the ſtream and current another way, making it hereby willing to ſubmit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>The eaſineſs of the work</hi> (although in it ſelf moſt hard) <hi>when once this Principle is thorowly implanted in the Soul,</hi> for it being <hi>a frame,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is more eaſie. An orderly frame condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth much to make any motion <hi>eaſie;</hi> take a thing out of <hi>frame,</hi> as a Clock, Watch, &amp;c. it moves hardly, and with difficulty, but when in <hi>frame,</hi> the motion is pleaſant and <hi>eaſie:</hi> So this <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to the <hi>Will of God</hi> being a <hi>frame</hi> of Soul, the work as to all particular acts, when once this is attained, goes on more <hi>eaſily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abrahams</hi> Soul being <hi>framed</hi> to it, it was <hi>eaſie</hi> work for <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to <hi>Gods will,</hi> God no ſooner ſaith, <hi>Abraham,</hi> leave thy Country, but he doth it. <hi>Abraham</hi> put the yoke of Circumciſion upon thy owne neck, and thy Families, and Poſterities, but he doth it. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> caſt one Son out of doors, offer up thy other, but he doth it. The like was in <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>The confluence of Grace that muſt be to work this.</hi> There muſt be <hi>more</hi> than <hi>one thing</hi> to make <hi>a frame,</hi> a Clock is <hi>framed</hi> of many wheels, a Building of ſundry materials; ſo this act is the reſult of the <hi>acting</hi> of <hi>many Graces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> that Gods Will is good, yea beſt for us.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Faith,</hi> to beleeve this.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Love,</hi> making us loath to go croſs to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115823:19"/>God, and of the two to chuſe rather, that God ſhould be pleaſed than we.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Humility,</hi> making us willing to ſtoop, and vail our wills to God; a proud will ſcorns to ſtoop.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Self-denial,</hi> cauſing us to lay our owne deſires and affections aſide.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Patience,</hi> enabling us to take any thing in good part from God, without hard thoughts, or words of, or againſt his Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Contentedneſs,</hi> in ſuffering God to take any thing from us, yea though it be our <hi>will,</hi> which the moſt of men had rather part with their lives than part with.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I call it a frame, <hi>wrought by the holy Spirit,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from meer <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral frames,</hi> or thoſe <hi>frames</hi> which may be in a man by the temper and diſpoſition of <hi>nature,</hi> or the exerciſe of <hi>morality</hi> Some perſons there are that either by <hi>natural a ſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>moral exerciſe,</hi> have ſo excel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115823:20"/>thereby nouriſh and allow in themſelves other Vices, as Self-eſtimation, Vain-glory, &amp;c. as repugnant to the <hi>Will of God</hi> (yea rather more) than any of the other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I call it a frame <hi>within us,</hi> to note the <hi>ſeat</hi> of it, which is the <hi>inward man.</hi> This <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to the <hi>Will of God</hi> it is a thing <hi>ſeated</hi> deep, in the innermoſt parts of the Soul. Hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It is not <hi>alwaies viſible</hi> in that Soul in which it is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It conſiſts not <hi>in notion and ſpeculation,</hi> (which is a thing more outward) ſo much as in the <hi>exerciſe of the heart,</hi> and action of the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It can be only <hi>in thoſe that are the true Children of God,</hi> and Members of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe in all others, not Gods Spirit, nor any thing of its, but Satan the Prince of Darkneſs bears rule in, and poſſeſſeth the inward man.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I call it ſuch a frame, by which <hi>the will of the Creature is brought freely, quietly, and with a holy delight to lay its ſelf down at the feet of God, to be diſpoſed of according to his will, not its owne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Freely,</hi> this proſtrating its ſelf and its will at the feet of God, is (where this grace of <hi>true ſubmiſſion</hi> to <hi>Gods will</hi> dwells) <hi>a free act.</hi> This diſtingu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>me. Some there are that will ſay when a croſs, an affliction comes, well, this is the <hi>Will of God,</hi> I muſt <hi>ſubmit</hi> to it; but this <hi>Divine ſubmiſſion</hi> is another thing, it makes the Soul not to <hi>ſubmit</hi> of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> but of <hi>choyſe.</hi> So
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115823:20"/>farre as this Grace acteth in any, the heart chooſeth to be, what it apprehends it is <hi>Gods Will</hi> it ſhould be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Quietly,</hi> that is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Without murmuring or repining at the thing.</hi> Though <hi>Iſrael</hi> followed the Cloud, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ſaid to go after God in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2.2. yet they did not ſubmit to Gods VVill, but were Rebels, <hi>Numb.</hi> 17.10. <hi>chap.</hi> 20.10. becauſe they were ever murmuring.</p>

                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Without ſtriving and ſtrugling againſt the ſtreame,</hi> i. e. running croſs in our affections, deſires, endeavours, to that thing which God is doing, or about to doe with us.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A quiet ſubmitting frame of Soul under this or that thing that is befallen it, though the thing in it ſelf, or at leaſtwiſe in the apprehenſion of the Soul hath ſomething that is evil in it (the evil of Puniſhment I mean, not of Sin) as Sickneſs, loſs of credit, eſtate, friends, &amp;c. upon this account, that this or that thing is befallen it, either through the agency or permiſſion of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to the <hi>Will of God</hi> as it reſpects things before us, and <hi>to come,</hi> is,</p>

                  <p n="1">1 <hi>IT is one of the higheſt demonſtrations of an One-neſs with God.</hi> The <hi>VVill</hi> is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and the <hi>ruling</hi> part in man, whilſt that is <hi>one with God,</hi> the whole man is <hi>one</hi> with him. When a King makes a League with another, all his Subjects make League with him; the <hi>VVill</hi> is King, Lord, chief Commander in the Soul, when that <hi>cloſeth with God,</hi> the whole man cloſeth; when the <hi>VVill</hi> melts into <hi>Gods VVill,</hi> and is ſwallowed up in it, all the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons melt together, and are ſwallowed up there-with.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>It conduceth greatly to a conſtant living in God, and to him;</hi> in improper phraſe we uſe to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115823:24"/>ſay, that a man is where his <hi>will</hi> is; if our <hi>wills</hi> be in Gods, our life is there. <hi>Enoch</hi> is ſaid to <hi>walk with God,</hi> but how? the Apoſtle tells us, Heb. 11.5. <hi>He pleaſed God,</hi> i. e. in effect to ſay, he ſerved not his <hi>owne will</hi> and deſires, but <hi>Gods.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="4">4 <hi>It is the moſt acceptable Sacrifice we can offer up to God; Abels</hi> Sacrifice found accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance becauſe it was of the fat, the <hi>will</hi> I may call the <hi>fat,</hi> for it is the <hi>beſt part</hi> of man, when this is offered up to God, we offer up the <hi>fat.

                  <p n="5">5 <hi>It is abundance of Grace in one lump,</hi> the exerciſe of <hi>much grace</hi> together, or in <hi>one act,</hi> as before I have noted.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 <hi>It is the moſt perfect imitation of Chriſt;</hi> the <hi>higheſt act</hi> (as I may ſo ſay) of Chriſts obedience, was his <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> of his <hi>will</hi> to his Fathers, therefore the Holy Ghoſt makes the whole of his obedience to lye chiefly in this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7, 8, 9. compared with <hi>Pſalm</hi> 40.6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 <hi>It is better for us to ſubmit to Gods VVill than to have our owne wills:</hi> there is no <hi>grate</hi>

                  <p n="2">2 Mind our diſtinction as touching <hi>ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to the <hi>wil of God,</hi> laid down at firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> There is a <hi>general and particular ſubmiſsion to</hi> Gods will; a <hi>general,</hi> when the Soules bent is to doe the will of God did it know it; <hi>a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi> when the Soul doth the Will of God in this or that thing ſo farre as it knows it; if therefore the preſent caſe be ſuch, that thou canſt not clearly and fully ſatisfie thy ſelf as to the <hi>particular</hi> act of <hi>ſubmiſſion,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>But the Soul not yet ſatisfied wil ſay, can there be no rule in ſuch caſes found out for me to goe by, though I have not an expreſs rule, yet have I not a rule at leaſt by conſequence, or a rule that will help me thus farre, that when I ſtand betwixt two waies, or two things, that I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that I may chuſe this way, or this thing rather than the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though there be not in this caſe <hi>a clear and punctual Rule,</hi> yet ſo much there is as that all things throughly weighed together, he thing in concluſion will amount to little leſs; now for direction herein mind what follows.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Obſerve narrowly which way that is, in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein thou mayeſt expect to meet with, and encounter moſt temptations, and ſhun that way;</hi> the Reaſon is of weight, becauſe the ſtrength and ſubtilty of the <hi>Tempter</hi> being above and beyond my wiſdom and ſtrength, I may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God put me upon him, ruſh my ſelf on him.</p>
                  <p>Indeed if I were aſſured that this, or that way were the way God <hi>wils</hi> me to go in, then put caſe I clearly ſaw the <hi>Tempter</hi> ſtand upon the Road, I may venture upon the face of him, becauſe as it is clearly my duty rather to venture being foyled, than to diſobey God, ſo the ſtrength and wiſdome of God which Faith can challenge as its own, whilſt it hath aſſurance its foot is in Gods way, is infinitely greater than all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and policy of the <hi>Tempter;</hi> and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it venture upon an enemy much ſtronger
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115823:29"/>than it ſelf, yet the power with it is greater than that againſt it: But when the caſe is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that I cannot ſee the <hi>will of God,</hi> I muſt be cautious how I venture into that Road, where I ſee the <hi>Devil</hi> to ſtand, and lye in wait for mee, leſt I lead my ſelf into <hi>temptation,</hi> which I ought not to do: Therefore the very ſeeing the <hi>Devil</hi> in this or that way, if I do not hear the Lords voyce ſaying, <hi>Go that way,</hi> is warning enough to bid mee take heed how I come there.</p>
                  <p>But the ſoul may reply to it ſelf, Perhaps, O my ſoul, thou doſt not like that way, and therefore thou fancieſt thou ſeeſt temptation there, and ſo flyeſt it, whereas if thou wouldeſt make the venture, thou ſhouldeſt finde it otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs a mans heart may eaſily deceive it ſelf, and ſuppoſe a <hi>temptation,</hi> and therewith fright it ſelf, when and where indeed is none.</p>
                  <p>At laſt it muſt bee anſwered <hi>by the ſoul it ſelf;</hi> For conſidering the different <hi>Natures, Principles,</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> and <hi>different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of grace</hi> given, that may bee a <hi>temptation</hi> to one man, which is none to another. As for example, a ſoul weak in the faith, every croſs providence, or the hearing of a threatning read, is a <hi>temptation</hi> to him to queſtion his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; But it is not ſo to him who is ſtrong in the faith: Again, a man of an affable kinde ſweet nature, the unkindneſs of one whom hee dearly loves, is a <hi>temptation</hi> to him, but not ſo to a man that is by nature ruffe and rugged. So for <hi>principles,</hi> one man hath a <hi>principle,</hi> to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115823:30"/>joyn in communion with ſuch onely as are of his opinion, anothers <hi>principle</hi> is to hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Saints as Saints; if the one meet with another, who is of a differing minde from himſelf, his own <hi>principle</hi> is a temptation to him, not ſo the others. Therefore the ſoul is beſt able to tell, after it hath taken an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial view of the meaſure of grace beſtowed upon it, whether more or leſs, its nature, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, diſpoſition, of all which (a man conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from under the <hi>byas</hi> of this, or the other <hi>temptation</hi> or <hi>corruption</hi>) is beſt judge himſelf: though yet, the Proverbial ſaying is true, (underſtanding it no otherwiſe then as a man is under the <hi>byas</hi> of ſome <hi>temptation,</hi> or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption) that no man is a competent judge of himſelf. I ſay therefore, when wee have ſaid all that wee can, upon this ground, the ſoul muſt make the concluſive anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve the <hi>tempations,</hi> and weigh them <hi>throughly,</hi> whether they are like to bee ſo to thee; For that may bee a <hi>temptation</hi> to one, that in it ſelf is none to another. Here you muſt have recourſe to the former <hi>Rules</hi> your <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, diſpoſition, nature,</hi> and <hi>meaſure of grace</hi> received. And when thou haſt in an equall ballance weighed all theſe, then becauſe thou haſt in the preſent caſe no other <hi>Rule,</hi> adviſe what <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſaith: And if upon a through debate <hi>Reaſon</hi> giveth in its verdict, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch a way an enemy doth lye; yet in an ordinary way his ſhot may not hurt thee; the weight of the caſe is much leſſened, yet do I not ſay it is anſwered, becauſe that may bee a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115823:30"/>
                     <hi>temptation</hi> to one, that in it ſelf may not bee to another; conſidering him according to the preſent mould of his principles, diſpoſition, &amp;c. yet in caſe there ſhould bee alteration in theſe, then may that which is a <hi>temptation</hi> to another, bee ſo to him alſo.</p>
                  <p>But now if contrariwiſe, <hi>Reaſon</hi> affirm, that upon a thorough pondering of all it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth, its moſt likely, that by reaſon of the preſent conſtitution of thy <hi>principles,</hi> &amp;c. This enemies ſhot ſhould reach thee, and it muſt bee a thing more than ordinary if it do not then &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve whether in ſuch a way, <hi>temptations</hi> are <hi>viſible to an eye of Reaſon;</hi> if ſo, then it is not a fantaſie, but a thing to bee heeded: For wee are now going by the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Right reaſon,</hi> and muſt diligently obſerve what it dictates; if <hi>Reaſon</hi> therfore (in ſuch a caſe as this is, in which the word ſaith nothing to mee) tell mee, there lyes an enemy in ambuſh in ſuch a way, I am herein to ſuffer my ſelf to be <hi>ruled</hi> by Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve the <hi>General Rules</hi> left thee in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſee whether thou canſt not out of them <hi>laid together,</hi> make up a <hi>rule,</hi> which ſhall bee Scripture-proof, which will ſolve the caſe; for know, that thoſe things which have not the <hi>particular Rules</hi> to order them, if they lye <hi>evidently</hi> within the compaſs of this, or that <hi>general Rule,</hi> the <hi>will of God,</hi> in them, is thereby determined as <hi>truly,</hi> though not ſo <hi>clearly</hi> (in my apprehenſion) as if I had a <hi>particular Rule</hi> to determine the <hi>will of God by:</hi> For the onely <hi>difference,</hi> betwixt <hi>general</hi> and <hi>particular Rules;</hi> is this, <hi>particular Rules</hi> point at a thing <hi>directly,</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:115823:31"/>and ſo are not ſubject to ſcruple or debate. <hi>General,</hi> by <hi>conſequence,</hi> and ſo are ſubject to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, by reaſon of mens <hi>various conſtructions</hi> of the <hi>Rule,</hi> and divers applications of particular caſes to it. But in caſe I have once found the <hi>general Rule,</hi> and am ſo guided by the Lord, as rightly to underſtand it, and apply the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſe to it, then will the concluſion thence drawn bee as ſound and firm, as if I had a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> word to bottome it upon.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But it may bee yet the ſoul may ſay, notwithstanding all that is ſaid from the general Rules, I remain ſtill in doubt, I am not yet ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, all doth not reach my caſe; Is there no other way yet to help mee to a ſight of the will of God, or at leaſt of that which is moſt expedient for mee to do in ſuch a caſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If wee have neither <hi>particular Rule,</hi> nor can finde any ſuch <hi>general Rule,</hi> as will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, then have wee nothing which may bear the name of a pure Scripture rule. There is no other <hi>Rule</hi> remaining, but onely that which wee call the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Right Reaſon,</hi> and the caſe being now come to this head, wee muſt bee <hi>ruled</hi> by that, or by none. And it is very meet in the preſent caſe <hi>Right reaſon</hi> ſhould bee our guide; for mark it, where I have not the word to walk by, I muſt walk by my <hi>reaſon:</hi> Reaſon (though Gods gift) is the light of a man, and where I want Gods light, God bids me uſe mine own, for therefore hath hee given it.</p>
                  <p>Now that wee may not bee miſtaken in the <hi>terme</hi> of <hi>Right reaſon,</hi> but underſtand what we are ſpeaking of; Know, that <hi>Right reaſon</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:115823:31"/>in Divine things, is that onely which draws up ſuch a concluſion, as is agreeable either to the principles of Natures law, or the ſubſtance of the truth left us in the written word: That <hi>Reaſon</hi> which makes up a concluſion that doth contradict either of theſe, is <hi>corrupt reaſon,</hi> not <hi>Right reaſon.</hi> The preſent caſe, therefore is to be ſolved by <hi>principles</hi> applied to it, conſonant to <hi>Natures law,</hi> or the ſubſtance of <hi>revealed Truth,</hi> and <hi>principles</hi> that are founded upon either of theſe, though they may not bee war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by any <hi>particular rule,</hi> nor eaſily drawn from this, or that <hi>general,</hi> yet are they <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of truth; For <hi>Natures law,</hi> though it bee a thing ſeated in man, yet it is originally from God, and ſo in it ſelf is a divine unerring thing; and the word though it conſiſts of many peeces, yet by a wonderful harmony, all is ſo knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that it makes in concluſion but one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire peece.</p>
                  <p>What therefore is rightly drawn from the whole body or ſubſtance of Scripture-truth laid together, is as much truth as that which is drawn from this or that particular text or peece of holy Writ. This premiſed, I now come to give in my particular anſwer to the caſe.</p>
                  <p>Now there are divers <hi>general Rules</hi> for us to have recourſe to in this thing.</p>
                  <p>The firſt <hi>GENERAL RULE</hi> is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Do all to the glory of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The true ſenſe and meaning of this <hi>Rule</hi> is, that <hi>Gods glory</hi> ſhould be propoſed by us, as our <hi>great and ultimate end</hi> in all our undertakings.</p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:115823:32"/>
                  <p>The caſe we are upon, is, <hi>What it moſt meet for mee to do when I ſtand betwixt two things, or two wayes, and muſt chuſe one, yet not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve my ſelf in which the</hi> will <hi>of God is?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſolution of the caſe from this <hi>General Rule,</hi> is, <hi>That I am to chuſe that thing or way, in, and by which, I may beſt reach the aforeſaid ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end.</hi> But now becauſe, when the caſe is ſuch, it is hard to know which thing or way, will moſt conduce to the attainment of this <hi>ultimate end,</hi> therefore we are yet in the dark, without ſomething further added.</p>
                  <p>Let it therefore be conſidered, that there is a twofold glorifying of God.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 A glorifying God in the <hi>intention of the Agent.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2 A glorifying God in the <hi>nature of the act.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Which conſiſteth in ſhunning and avoiding ſuch things by which God is diſhonoured, and in our following and imbracing ſuch actions which have in them a tendency to glorifie him.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>glorifying of God in the intention of the agent;</hi> is not indeed properly a <hi>glorifying</hi> of God, in caſe the other bee not joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, for a man through ignorance of the <hi>will of God,</hi> may do ſuch an action as is in it ſelf evill, and tends to the diſhonour of God, and that with a good intention. <hi>Peters</hi> intention was <hi>good,</hi> viz. to preſerve his Maſter from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and this ſprung from his love and affection to him, when hee diſſwaded him from going up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſuffer: Yet was his <hi>action evil,</hi> and tending much to the diſhonour of God.</p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:115823:32"/>
                  <p>In the latter therefore, but ſo as joyned with the former, this <hi>active glorifying of God,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, when as together with my <hi>good intention</hi> to <hi>glorifie God,</hi> there is ſomething in the nature of the act it ſelf which I perform, that hath a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to glorifie God.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the preſent caſe, would I know whether my going this way, or that way, will moſt <hi>glorifie God?</hi> Why then conſider, not onely the <hi>different wayes,</hi> but conſider alſo thine own <hi>action;</hi> thy action lyes in thy <hi>motion,</hi> as there is a way, and a way, ſo alſo there is a <hi>motion</hi> in it, this or that way, in this <hi>motion</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the nature of the <hi>act:</hi> Now if there bee any thing in this <hi>motion</hi> (conſider it apart from the <hi>intention,</hi> for that is another thing) that hath a tendency either to ſtrip God of any part of his honour, or contrariwiſe to <hi>glorifie him,</hi> then I may by it conclude which way I am to take: If in my <hi>motion</hi> on one hand I intrench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods honor in this or that point, then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever my <hi>intention</hi> is (though ſeemingly ever ſo pious) yet muſt I not venture there, becauſe there is an evill, and a diſhonour to God in the nature of the act; If on the other hand, I doe not onely <hi>intend</hi> Gods honour, but can alſo carry it along with mee, and viſibly hold it forth in the way as I go, then may I ſafely go there, yea that is the way I am to take.</p>
                  <p>To illuſtrate this in a particular caſe, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I ſtand betwixt two wayes, and I cannot ſee that there is the will of God more in this than in that, I may in that reſpect chuſe either. But the caſe is this, betwixt mee, and this way
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115823:33"/>lyes ſome promiſe, engagement, covenant, &amp;c. ſo that I cannon enter this way but I muſt goe over the head of it; no ſuch thing as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, what ſhall I now doe?</p>
                  <p>VVhy, I muſt avoyd, that way which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come at, but muſt goe over my promiſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, &amp;c. to reach it.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is, becauſe here is evil, <hi>viz.</hi> breach of promiſe in my very <hi>motion,</hi> or the nature of the <hi>act,</hi> how good therefore ſoever my <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> may be, yet that will not help, becauſe here is an evil in the very thing it ſelf, and <hi>a good intention</hi> may not <hi>byaſſe</hi> me to an evil thing; indeed were it clear and manifeſt that this way and no other were the way of God, then my duty is rather than to baulk Gods path, to be humbled for that Promiſe, engagement, &amp;c. which I made in mine ignorance, becauſe I am rather to break my promiſe, the making of which was but an act of mine owne will, than knowingly to act contrary to any part of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will of God.</p>
                  <p>But when neither this way, nor the other can be made appear to be that way, that God in oppoſition to all other wayes bids me walk in, then in caſe upon the mouth of the one way a Promiſe or Covenant lye, that I cannot goe into it but muſt tread thereupon, and no ſuch thing on the other, then am I from hence to learn ſo much as to ſhun that way, and cleave unto the other.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond GENERAL RVLE is this, <hi>Let all things be done to the uſe of edifying,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The true ſence of the <hi>Rule</hi> is this, that I am
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115823:33"/>to <hi>preferre</hi> the <hi>edification</hi> of my Brother <hi>before any outward intereſt or advantage of mine owne;</hi> or in a word, before any thing wherein I may pleaſe my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The caſe is as before, <hi>what is moſt meet for me to doe, &amp;c.</hi> The ſolution of the caſe from this <hi>General Rule</hi> is, that <hi>I am in my choyce to preferre that thing or way before another, which doth moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly further my brothers edification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that we rightly underſtand this thing, and may not, whilſt our deſign is to ſatisfie Conſcience, involve it in greater and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate Snares, minde this; That we are not now ſpeaking of the <hi>means of edification,</hi> but of <hi>edification it ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 If the Queſtion were about the <hi>means of edification,</hi> then from this <hi>general Rule,</hi> it will follow; that,</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Saints who by walking together have greatly furthered each others <hi>edification,</hi> muſt never part; VVhy? becauſe theſe two cannot be ſeparated from each other, bur there will be an hinderance of <hi>edification,</hi> as to that particular means; that <hi>edification</hi> which they had, the one by the other, is hindered by their ſeparation; but this cannot be, for then could not the ſeparation of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who doubtleſs whilſt they walked together did <hi>edifie</hi> one another, have been a thing lawful, becauſe it had been againſt this <hi>general Rule;</hi> nor can the ſeparation of one Saint from another, which may be juſtifiable upon the account of their meer outward employments, which may call one this way, another that way (and yet this
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115823:34"/>call be no more but civil) according to this ſenſe be accounted lawful; note therefore that we ſpeak not of the <hi>means,</hi> but of <hi>edification</hi> it ſelf, I ſhall therefore here lay down theſe two diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That there is <hi>a difference between the greatening and leſſening of a Brothers edification, and edification it ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>means</hi> of a Brothers edification may bee greater, when yet his <hi>edification</hi> is leſs; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, the <hi>means</hi> of his edification may be leſs, when yet his <hi>edification</hi> is greater; this is a caſe ſo clear that it needs no proof; for the hearts of many Saints will put their ſeal to this, that in a time when they had <hi>leſs means</hi> of edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication (perhaps not an edifying Sermon once in a moneth) they were yet more <hi>edified,</hi> did more thrive and grow in grace, than ſince the time that they had more plentiful means of edification; and the reaſon is, becauſe when Saints are kept more hungry, they feed more heartily upon food when they can get it; but when they are full fed, ſuch is the corruption of the heart, that inſtead of feeding, it growes wanton, and plaies with its meat, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is and hath been found a real truth in common experience, that when Saints get but now and then a meal, or if they have it oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet get it with ſome hardſhip, they thrive beſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There is <hi>a difference betwixt want of all means of edification, and a want of this or that particular means, which either is moſt eaſie to come by, or which they have uſually found moſt comfort and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115823:34"/>refreſhment from;</hi> or take it thus,</p>
                  <p>There is <hi>a difference betwixt the ſhutting up this or that particular door, which either ſtands neareſt to us, or thorow which moſt ordinarily wee have received edification, and the ſhutting up all doors by which our edification hath come in;</hi> this or that means which ſtands neareſt to us may be removed, and yet not our edification de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>The thing deſtroyed is only our eaſe, wee may have <hi>edification</hi> ſtill, though with more pains, in caſe other <hi>means of edification,</hi> but ſomewhat more remote, be to be enjoyed.</p>
                  <p>Again, this or that <hi>means</hi> which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived moſt comfort and refreſhment from, may be taken away, and yet not our <hi>edification</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, becauſe God is no where tyed to give us comfort ſtill by the <hi>ſame means,</hi> nor is there any promiſe upon which we may expect it; nay let me ſay (and it is a truth, although it will be hardly received) our <hi>edification</hi> may hereby be furthered, and the reaſon is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the heart is very prone when it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived comfort from this or that means, to make an Idol of it; and it is the common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of the heart, that the more <hi>edification</hi> it hath, or doth receive from any particular means, the more it doth dote upon it, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by degrees from <hi>edification</hi> to an admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Perſons; now when the caſe is ſuch, that the heart is grown to make an Idol of the <hi>means,</hi> then God will either remove the Idol, or elſe make it leſs fruitful to that ſoul.</p>
                  <p>And when once an <hi>admiration</hi> of Perſons,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115823:35"/>(which is a thing that ſecretly creeps upon us, and the more (I ſay) by how much wee have received the more benefit from a perſon) is gotten into the ſoul, that will lye as ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Core at the bottome, as will hinder all true <hi>edification;</hi> Therefore I <hi>ſay,</hi> the taking <hi>away</hi> of this, or that <hi>particular means,</hi> by which we have received comfort and refreſhment, may bee ſo far from <hi>hindring,</hi> that it may bee indeed a <hi>help</hi> to our <hi>edification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to apply the Rule unto our caſe:</p>
                  <p>If it bee ſo, that the moving this <hi>way,</hi> or that way doth onely leſſen the means of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>edification,</hi> or deprive him of that means which either ſtands neereſt to him, ſuits moſt with his eaſe, or which hee hath received moſt comfort, and refreſhment from, it doth not at all reach our preſent caſe, nor determine it: But if by moving this way or that <hi>way, Edification</hi> it ſelf is hindred, and all outward means that can bee had, removed, then doth it come into our caſe, and when the caſe is ſuch, this <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule</hi> determines, that I am to cleave to that way, which by leaving the edification it ſelf of a brother, and all ſuch outward means as <hi>may</hi> any way help it forward, are deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>The third <hi>GENERAL R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LE</hi> is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Foflow thoſe things that make for peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The true ſenſe and meaning of the <hi>Rule</hi> is, That <hi>I am in my walking, and acting, to have a ſpecial reſpect to thoſe things that make for the peace and unity of the Saints, or the myſtical body of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rule</hi> is as before: The ſolution of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115823:35"/>caſe from this <hi>General Rule</hi> is, That <hi>I am to do that thing, chuſe that way, which tends moſt to keeping and maintaining peace among the Saints:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that wee may not fetter conſcience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſetting it at liberty; it is neceſſary that wee conſider how far this <hi>Rule</hi> doth oblige us, and how far not; for <hi>General Rules,</hi> are but ſnares to conſcience, if <hi>they</hi> bee not warily laid down with their due cautions and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: To bring this caſe therefore into the light, I ſhall here inquire into, What that is I am to diſpence with in reference unto peace, and What not.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 What I am not to to diſpenſe with:</p>
                  <p>Anſw. <hi>I am not to diſpenſe with the parting from any one dram of clear truth:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 The reaſon is, becauſe that <hi>peace</hi> is an <hi>evill peace</hi> that doth ſhut truth out of doors, if <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> cannot go together, <hi>truth</hi> is to bee preferred, and rather to bee choſen for a companion than <hi>peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there is good reaſon for this alſo, becauſe <hi>truth</hi> is a peece of Gods nature peace is but one of our priviledges; mans priviledges muſt rather be loſt, than Gods nature ſuffered to bee trodden underfoot, if therefore the excellent priviledge of <hi>peace,</hi> cannot be attained without intrenching upon the limits of the more excellent thing <hi>truth,</hi> wee muſt then give way to <hi>truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>I am not for peace ſake to diſpence with any act that ſhall countenance corruption in a brother.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe I am not to ſuffer ſin to lye upon a brother; it ſo, then not to <hi>countenance</hi> any evill in him, for that is more; the one is a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115823:36"/>meer negative act, and yet ſinful, becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; the other a poſitive, and therefore more ſinfult: If therefore for peace ſake I ſhall humor a brother in his corruptions, as pride, paſſion, &amp;c. When theſe are evident, and apparent, I do that which I ought not; I ſhould rather break <hi>peace</hi> with a brother than contract guilt on mine own head.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>I am not for peace ſake to diſpenſe with any palpable affront or injury offered by a brother to the cauſe or truth of Chriſt.</hi> The reaſon is; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt's <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> is better, and more honourable, and therefore rather to bee ſtuck to than mans <hi>peace;</hi> if therefore a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeaks ſlightly of Chriſts cauſe, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of any part of his <hi>truth,</hi> I am in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>way</hi> to vindicate it, if <hi>my</hi> vindication of it break <hi>peace</hi> in this caſe, let it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>I am not for peace ſake to diſpenſe with any ſuperſtitious cuſtome and practice of a brother, which may endanger the welfare of the ſouls of others.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>ſoul</hi> is of more worth than <hi>peace; peace</hi> if loſt may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, the loſs of <hi>ſouls</hi> is irrecoverable: Mans eternal being conſiſts in the welfare of his <hi>ſoul,</hi> his temporal well-being onely is wrapt up in his <hi>peace;</hi> I am to prefer mans eternal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before his temporal well-being. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the <hi>ſuperſtitious cuſtomes</hi> or <hi>practiſes</hi> of a brother, another ſoul ſhall bee endangered, I am to declare againſt thoſe <hi>cuſtomes</hi> or <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> although it bee to the breach of <hi>peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>I am not for peace ſake to diſpenſe with the ſhaking of a weak beleever in his faith.</hi> The
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115823:36"/>reaſon is, <hi>Faith</hi> is the Root, <hi>peace</hi> is but the branch: If the branch bee lopped off, and the root remaine unmaymed, the branch will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover again, but if the root bee maymed, root, and branch dye both; the ſhaking of the root is therefore a greater evil, than the lopping off the branch, when therefore the root <hi>faith</hi> is ſhaken, I am to relieve that, though it bee with the lopping off the branch of <hi>peace.</hi> Upon this account <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. doth <hi>openly</hi> oppoſe <hi>Peter,</hi> when hee <hi>by</hi> complying with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to eat meat with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hazard the <hi>weak faith,</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6 <hi>I am not for peace ſake to diſpenſe with a deſigning ſpirit in a brother.</hi> The reaſon is, whilſt a brother <hi>deſignes</hi> upon mee, hee doth never really intend <hi>peace</hi> with mee, though I do it with him; I am not therefore for <hi>peace</hi> ſake to diſpenſe with that which hath a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary tendency to cut mee ſhort of mine end: When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw deſigning brethren coming in upon him, hee would not give place, no not for an hour, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11, 12, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 <hi>I am not for peace ſake to diſpenſe with a wilful ſpirit in a brother, becauſe with ſuch a one I can neither make peace, nor keep it when it is made, unleſs in every thing I ſubject my ſelf to his will.</hi> Now it is better to ſtand off from <hi>peace,</hi> than for the attaining and keeping thereof, to put my ſelf under the ſlavery of anothers will; For the loſs of liberty to my ſelf and others hereby on the one hand, is greater than the gain that on the other hand will redound to me: Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> who did oftentimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115823:37"/>when hee could keep his liberty, would never comply when and where hee muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe it by complying.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 And laſtly, <hi>I am not for peace ſake to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with a lording domineering ſpirit in a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or a ſpirit that affects preheminence.</hi> The reaſon is in a manner the ſame with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, becauſe ſuch a ſpirit will bee a Lord, and hee muſt have others as his ſervants, or hee will have no <hi>peace</hi> with them. Now to make a league upon ſuch terms is expreſly againſt the <hi>Rule,</hi> which condemns ſuch a ſpirit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.25, 26, 27 28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophes</hi> his affecting <hi>preheminence</hi> was not to bee born with out of reſpect to the Churches <hi>peace,</hi> 3 Epiſt. of <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 But what then, am I to diſpenſe with in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto peace?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I am to diſpenſe <hi>with ſome things which are truths, as to this or that ſeaſon, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 I am for <hi>peace</hi> ſake to diſpenſe <hi>with a ſtiffe and peremptory inſiſting upon this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular thing ſuppoſed by mee to bee truth, in caſe it be in it ſelf doubtful.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe the maintaining of the thing, cannot bee a known duty, ſo long as the thing it ſelf is not known to bee a truth: But now on the other ſide, breach of <hi>peace</hi> (if it bee not upon due grounds and conſiderations) is a known evill, and I may not commit the leaſt known evill, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the greateſt unknown duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nay,</hi> nothing in the world can acquit mee of guilt in doing the leaſt known evill, but this, when I muſt either neglect ſome duty that is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115823:37"/>greater, and weighs more heavy, or ruſh my ſelf upon ſome evill of more dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, in caſe I neglect it; when the caſe is ſuch, the <hi>Rule</hi> is, of two evills I muſt chuſe the leaſt: This is the caſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. where the Apoſtles whole diſcourſe runs upon things which are doubtfull, not determined.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 I am for <hi>peace</hi> ſake to diſpenſe <hi>with mine own will,</hi> if nothing ſtand in the way of <hi>peace</hi> but my <hi>will</hi> onely, I am, rather than to hinder the free paſſage of <hi>peace,</hi> to remove that; for the <hi>peace</hi> of the Saints is a thing of far greater concernment, than my having my will; there is nothing of evill againſt God in the one, but there is in the other; <hi>peace</hi> is a ſpiritual thing, mans <hi>will</hi> is but a natural; natural things muſt give place to ſpiritual, the end of <hi>peace</hi> is <hi>edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> the end of having my <hi>will</hi> is but to pleaſe my ſelf. I muſt prefer <hi>edification</hi> before the pleaſing of my ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 I am for <hi>peace</hi> ſake to diſpenſe <hi>with many things, the particular intereſt of mine honour, profit, &amp;c. Abraham</hi> though the elder, for <hi>peace</hi> ſake gives place to <hi>Lot</hi> the younger, to chuſe before him the place of his habitation, upon ſo doing for <hi>peace</hi> ſake, hee at once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth with honour and profit both: <hi>Peace</hi> is a duty, our intereſts and advantages muſt give place to our duties; yet here take this caution and limitation, if the caſe bee ſuch, that by my reſigning my particular intereſt and advantage, I ſhall diſadvantage <hi>truth</hi> it ſelf; I am then to hold it, though it bee with ſo great a hazard as the loſs of peace; for though I may not hold
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115823:38"/>mine advantage upon mine own account to the prejudice of <hi>peace,</hi> becauſe neither my ſelfe, nor the thing in which my advantage lyes, are of worth equivalent to <hi>peace,</hi> yet I may upon the account of <hi>truth,</hi> becauſe that is of greater worth.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> perceived <hi>truth</hi> it ſelf to bee ſtruck at through a ſleighty eſteem of his perſon, then he who in his heart had as low thoughts of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as they could have of him, yet now ſtands up boldly, and pleads the point of his honour, preferring himſelf (though for ought hee knew he might anger <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and ſo hazard a breach of peace) before <hi>Peter, James,</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> or any of them all.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 I am for <hi>peace</hi> ſake to diſpenſe <hi>with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular wrongs and injuries done to my ſelf.</hi> I ſpeak not now as to civill injuries, that queſtion appertains to another caſe; but I mean ſuch as are of a more ſpiritual nature, as cenſuring me as touching my ſpiritual condition, brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mee for an Heretick, Schiſmatick, Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, &amp;c. endeavouring to ſet others againſt mee, &amp;c. I am ſilently to put up many things of this nature, rather than to break the <hi>peace;</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe while I put theſe up, the wrong is onely my own, but in breaking the <hi>peace,</hi> I may injure myſelf, and many others alſo.</p>
                  <p>The putting up of theſe quietly for <hi>peace</hi> ſake, is an act of ſelf-denial, and ſo a fruit of the ſpirit. The making a ſtir and coile about theſe things, till <hi>peace</hi> is broken, is a pure ſelfiſh buſineſs, and ſo a fruit of the fleſh; yet take
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115823:38"/>this alſo with two Cautions.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 <hi>I muſt ſo put it up as not to doe that in way of Self-denial, as may any way allow of the act it ſelf;</hi> for though the evil of the act is to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently borne, yet the act it ſelf being evil, is not to be allowed.</item>
                     <item>2 I muſt alſo <hi>conſider warily, whether there be not ſome thing in the action that brings Gods Truth and Honour to the ſtake together with my ſelf;</hi> if ſo, I may and ought to take upon me my owne reſcue, not for the ſake of my ſelf, but of Gods Truth and Honour ingaged with me. I am to diſpence <hi>with errour in judgement in a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it ariſe from weakneſs, and be not obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and pertinaciouſly maintained,</hi> becauſe error of judgement is only a privative evil, breach of <hi>peace,</hi> a poſitive.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>But when may an errour of judgement be ſaid to be of weakneſs, not</hi> wilfulneſs, <hi>or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. VVhen a Brothers judgement is weak in all things elſe, which is eaſily known by this, if he be readily drawn to this thing, or that, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 VVhen a Brother ſeeing a man of more grace than himſelf, ſo or ſo appropriated, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects his judgement to the others grace.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>When of wilfulneſs, or pertinacy?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, When he will ſtabliſh any Principles though never ſo contrary to faith and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to hold up his errour rather than ſuffer it to fall.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When he cares not what other Principles of his owne he pluck up by the roots,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115823:39"/>ſo he may thereby keep that one Principle in which the errour lyes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, VVhen a man pretends much Conſcience as to that particular Principle, but makes no Conſcience of his practiſe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of greater and more weighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.</p>
                  <p>Now to apply our <hi>Rule</hi> to the preſent Caſe, if by doing this or that thing, moving this or that way, I either doe or ſhall diſpence with any of thoſe things which I ought not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with, or contrariwiſe ſhall not diſpence with any of thoſe things that for <hi>peace-ſake</hi> I ought to diſpence with, then am I by this general Rule to ſhun that way, and chuſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth <hi>GENERAL RVLE, is,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, &amp;c. Walk in wiſdome towards them that are without.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The true intent and purport of this <hi>Rule</hi> is, that a Chriſtian ſhould ſo <hi>order his ſteps</hi> in the way of truth and holineſs, that <hi>poor ſinners</hi> by beholding his <hi>converſation,</hi> might not finde cauſe to <hi>harden their hearts</hi> in their owne <hi>wayes of iniquity,</hi> but might be won to <hi>a love of the waies of God,</hi> the caſe is ſtill as before.</p>
                  <p>The Solution is, <hi>That I am to chuſe that path by walking;</hi> in which I ſhall take away occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hardning poor Sinners, and lay before them an occaſion of winning and drawing them to a love and liking of the ways of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Now would we know what that is which laies occaſion of hardning before Sinners, and what that is which on the other ſide wins them to a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115823:39"/>love and liking of the waies of Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> One principal thing amongſt many others by which Sinners are hardned is <hi>When they ſee Profeſſors making no conſcience of ſuch things as they themſelves (at leaſtwiſe they think ſo) would if they were in their ſtead make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>VVhen they ſee Perſons pretending much more holineſs than they, break thoſe bands of outward and civil holineſs, which (their very Natural conſcience laies ſuch an awe upon them, as) they dare not break; this is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great hardning to ſinners, eſpecially the more refined ſort of them, your Civilians, or Morraliſts, who have partly by Natures light, and partly by the light they have into things honeſt and juſt by the written VVord, ſuch a tye upon their Conſcience, that when they have an advantage, yet many times they dare not tranſgreſs the <hi>Rules</hi> of equity and righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, this is a thing very taking with Sinners, and renders the waies of Chriſt amiable in their eyes, <hi>when they ſee Profeſſors conſcientious in ſmaller things as well as greater; ſuch things wherein they are not abſolutely bound up, but have a kinde of liberty left them by the Lawes of God and men, yet are as tender and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious leaſt they ſhould abuſe this their liberty, as though they were bound:</hi> of ſuch Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours; you may hear the worſt ſay, we are perſwaded that he is no Hipocrite, if there be one among them that is what he maketh ſhew of, that is he.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:115823:40"/>
                  <p>Now when I am thus between two wayes, or things, and muſt chuſe one, yet know not in which the VVill of God is, then obſerve, is there any thing in this or that way that may tend (ſhould I walk in it) to harden poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their owne wayes, and will my quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it make them have the better thoughts of the wayes of God, then I am bound by this <hi>rule</hi> to ſhun this way and chuſe ſome other.</p>
                  <p>Our Fifth <hi>GENERAL RVLE</hi> is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, think on theſe things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The true ſence of the <hi>Rule</hi> is, That a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in his actions ſhould have a ſpecial reſpect to ſuch things as are in themſelves honeſt and juſt.</p>
                  <p>The Caſe is as before.</p>
                  <p>The Solution is, <hi>That I am to chuſe that thing, walk in that way, which is neareſt to the general Rule of honeſty and juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Queſtion here will be, <hi>What the rule of Justice is?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſ. 1. <hi>Not mans Principles;</hi> for theſe may be corrupt, and a corrupted <hi>Principle</hi> may call that juſt which is in it ſelf unjuſt, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, which is in its ſelf moſt juſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Not humane Lawes;</hi> for theſe not having a reſpect unto the righteous Law of God, are oft-times corrupt; and a corrupt Law may authoriſe thoſe acts as juſt which in themſelves are ſinful, and puniſh as unjuſt, even righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Not my ſuppoſing my ſelf willing that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould doe by me as I doe by another.</hi> This is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115823:40"/>not the rule of juſtice, and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe mans heart which is deceitful above all things, and ſo deſperately wicked as none can know it, doth leave a perſon under manifold miſtakes here, and a man does oft think that he is willing to be dealt by as he deals by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when as indeed it is not ſo. And there are theſe two things which cauſe this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>A man doth never take ſo deeply into his conſideration that caſe which is anothers, as hee doth and would doe his owne;</hi> If the caſe be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, an overly and general view of it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him, but when it is his owne, then will he ponder the caſe it ſelf in every circumſtance, and if there be any thing grating in it, he will view it in every aggravation; one while he wil conſider the perſon that doth it, if there be any thing which may aggravate it therein; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while the time, if any thing may bee found therein to aggravate; another while he will be calling to remembrance other injuries, (if there be any) and by theſe help to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the preſent caſe.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuppoſing the caſe it ſelf to be ſmall, yet in the aggravations which a man in his owne caſe will diligently conſider of, it may grow to be great; but this a man will not do in anothers caſe, as he that doth anothers work to make quick work, and put himſelf to as little toyl as may be, will poſt and ſlubber it over; ſo he that conſiders anothers caſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>A mans not knowing what indeed, and in truth he would be willing another ſhould do by him.</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:115823:41"/>Wee think wee know our hearts in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe exceeding well, but when it comes to the triall, wee finde that our hearts did but juggle with us. And indeed, there is no man can tell what hee would bee willing another ſhould do by him till hee is put to the triall; nor it may bee then neither, if hee do not obſerve his own heart well, but give a caſt of his eye upon that which appears at the top onely, not obſerving the ſecret boylings and workings that may lye at the bottome.</p>
                  <p>And that no man knows what that thing is which hee would bee willing another ſhould do by him, will bee clear to a man himſelf, let him but conſider this, it may be ſome time paſt, there was this or that thing that I thought I could have been willing another ſhould have done by me; and it may be ſince ſomething hath fallen out either in that particular thing, or it may bee in a leſſe thing that I have been ſo, and ſo dealt with by another: How have I taken it, why a hundred to one, if I obſerve my heart, not in all things ſo willingly as I thought I ſhould.</p>
                  <p>And indeed mans heart is ſuch, that if it would but ſpeak out, and declare it ſelf natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, it would not bee willing that another ſhould do that thing to it, which hath but the leaſt of evill in it: And it is in this ſenſe that Chriſt who knew the frame and temper of the heart of every man did give forth this rule, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thus much in it, that wee ſhould not do to another that thing which hath in it the leaſt ſhew of evill, or injury, for our hearts if
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115823:41"/>they utter themſelves in plain language, will not bear with it, that any ſuch thing ſhould bee done to us.</p>
                  <p>And this is the true interpretation of that rule which was laid down by him who knew the heart, and ſo knew better what mans heart could bear, than man himſelf doth.</p>
                  <p>And if our Comment upon the <hi>Rule</hi> bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts ſenſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> not to do the leaſt injury to another, becauſe my heart in truth would not bear it, that any by another ſhould be done to mee, then is it indeed a <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>univerſal Rule</hi> of Righteouſneſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if the Comment bee according to our ſenſe, Ile do this, or that particular evill to another, but it is no more than I would bee willing another ſhould do to mee, it is then <hi>no Rule,</hi> but a deceit, and my heart makes uſe of it only to juggle with mee.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>But what then is the rule of Justice and Righteouſneſs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſw. <hi>The declared Law and Will of God left us in his word.</hi> What ever things or actions (how ever they may bee eſteemed in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt principles of men, or how ever they may be judged of by the Laws of men, or what ever concluſions my heart may make upon them) are there declared juſt, are ſo; or unjuſt, are ſo.</p>
                  <p>Now to apply this <hi>General rule,</hi> unto our particular caſe; If it bee ſo that my doing this thing, or that thing, my moving this way, or that way, doth but in the leaſt intrench upon this, or the other thing, that any where in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115823:42"/>word of God is allowed of and commended to us as a thing honeſt and juſt. Then am I bound by this <hi>General rule</hi> to ſhun that way, and chuſe another.</p>
                  <p>Our 6. and laſt <hi>GENERAL RULE,</hi> is, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report, think on theſe things.</hi> The phraſe of <hi>doing things comely,</hi> relates alſo to this <hi>Rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſenſe of the <hi>Rule</hi> is, That a Chriſtian in <hi>ordering</hi> his <hi>converſation,</hi> is to have a <hi>ſpecial eye</hi> to thoſe things that have a <hi>beautiful aſpect,</hi> and are <hi>well-reported of</hi> by others.</p>
                  <p>The caſe is ſtill the ſame. The ſolution is, that <hi>I am to walke in that way, do that thing, in doing which my action ſhall become moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and bee beſt reported of by others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This therefore is the application of our <hi>Rule,</hi> that when I ſtand betwixt two ſuch things as the caſe ſuppoſeth, if there bee good report following mee if I move this way, but evill if I move in that, then am I to ſhun that way, and move in this.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for <hi>General Rules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here again, that wee may not intangle conſcience, and bring it into bonds whilſt wee would ſet it free; minde it, That wee are in making up our judgement to look as well at the action in it ſelf, as at the <hi>comely aſpect</hi> and report made thereof by others, becauſe the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of men is ſuch, that thereby an <hi>evill action,</hi> hath ſometimes a good name, and is ſet forth in a good dreſſe, and a good <hi>unblameable action</hi> an evill name, and ſet forth in a deformed dreſſe.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:115823:42"/>
                  <p>As therefore an action when it is apparently evill, may not bee ventured upon, becauſe it hath a good report, and comely dreſſe; ſo on the other ſide, an <hi>action</hi> which is apparently good and juſtifiable, may not bee ſhunned, becauſe of an evill report, or ill-favoured dreſſe. For mark it, there are two wayes by which that thing, which ſimply conſidered is <hi>good,</hi> may have an <hi>ill report,</hi> and an unhandſome dreſſe put upon it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Through the common abuſe of that thing by ſuch as meddle in it, and with it,</hi> in the work of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>As for inſtance, Suppoſe a man moves out of one ſtation into another, or one place into another, and this his moving as the caſe may bee, ſtands with his outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage alſo, as well as with his work, becauſe moſt men that thus move, have carnall ends and deſignes in ſo doing, aiming more at ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themſelves than Chriſt. Hence it comes to paſſe that there is an <hi>ill report,</hi> and an ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured dreſſe commonly put upon the thing it ſelf, yet may the <hi>action</hi> notwithſtanding bee <hi>good,</hi> and ſuch, as a man may have a clear call from God to do it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Through forged accuſation, that may bee laid againſt this, or that thing.</hi> As for inſtance, Suppoſe a company of Saints meet together often at ſuch a houſe to pray, a <hi>ſhameful report,</hi> (as it hath been ſo with the meetings of Saints in time paſt) goes about the Country as touching this meeting: Shall I therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I now ſtood between theſe two things, either to go to my calling, or ſuch a meeting,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115823:43"/>and I may without breach of any particular and poſitive precept do either; For though I am commanded to frequent the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of Saints, yet no command binds mee up, as to this or that time: <hi>I</hi> ſay in ſuch a caſe ſhall <hi>I</hi> ſay to my ſelfe, there goes an <hi>ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> abroad of that meeting, therefore <hi>I</hi> will go to my calling; no, why, becauſe though there is an <hi>ill report</hi> of the thing, yet the thing in it ſelfe, is a thing good, lovely, and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>But now when the caſe is ſuch, that <hi>I</hi> ſtand betwixt two things, that are not by any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Rule</hi> in the word determined to bee good or evill in themſelves, <hi>I</hi> am then to minde this <hi>General rule of good and bad report,</hi> and thereby to chuſe or refuſe.</p>
                  <p>As for example, for a Profeſſor when his buſineſs calls him into an Alehouſe, &amp;c. which a man upon his neceſſary occaſions ſometimes muſt do, the word hath no where determined how long hee ſhould ſtay there, as that its law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſtay ſo long, but ſinful if longer; this the word ſaith nothing to, therefore the thing is not (in caſe hee abuſe not himſelfe there) by any particular <hi>Rule,</hi> good, or evill: But now becauſe it is of an <hi>ill report,</hi> for a Profeſſor eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when perhaps hee hath little to do there, to ſit two or three houres in an Alehouſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by this <hi>General rule,</hi> his act is evill, and hee is to avoid ſuch a thing.</p>
                  <p>Put caſe I do <hi>clearly ſee the will of God</hi> in a thing, but there are <hi>great difficulties</hi> in the way, by which I finde my ſelf diſheartned
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115823:43"/>from going up to that thing which I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced is Gods will: How ſhall I in this caſe <hi>bring up my will to Gods?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is moſt certain where <hi>Gods will is clear,</hi> wee are to venture all to get up to it; but the Queſtion is how when <hi>diſcouraging difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> lye in our way, our wills may bee brought to make this venture. Take theſe few Rules for anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Conſult more what thy duty is, than what the difficulty is.</hi> So did <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 12.1, 2, 3. <hi>Now the Lord ſaid unto Abram, Get thee out of thy Country, and from thy kindred, and from thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, unto a land that I will ſhew thee, and I will make of thee a great Nation, and I will bleſs thee, and make thy name great, and thou ſhalt bee a bleſſing, and I will bleſs them that bleſs thee, and curſe him that curſeth thee; and in thee ſhall all families of the earth bee bleſſed. So Abram de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, as the Lord had ſpoken unto him; and Lot went with him, and Abram was ſeventy five years old when hee departed out of Haran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 1.16, 17. <hi>To reveal his Son in mee, that I might preach him among the Heathen; immediately I conferred not with fleſh and blood; neither went I up to Jeruſalem, to them which were Apoſtles before mee, but I went into Arabia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Caſt away all that of the difficulty, which is but ſuppoſed.</hi> We <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> when we are called to a duty ten times as many <hi>difficulties</hi> as there are: How many <hi>ſuppoſed difficulties</hi> did <hi>Moſes</hi> ſet before himſelf when God was ſending him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet when hee comes there, hee meets
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115823:44"/>with never a one of them according as hee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. Did wee but throw away all our <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed difficulties</hi> (which perhaps when it comes to, we ſhall never meet with) and take up ſuch onely as are real, the burden of <hi>difficulties</hi> would not bee half ſo heavy as ordinarily it is.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Convert thy diſcouragement into an incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Thy <hi>difficulties</hi> before thee are thy <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,</hi> why now convert them into an <hi>incouragement,</hi> thus, ſay to thy ſelf, Surely, in yonder thing is either ſome great mercy for mee, or ſome great work for mee to do, that there are ſo many <hi>difficulties</hi> in the way. Temptations and <hi>difficulties</hi> are the conſtant attendants of opportunities of mercy, or of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſervice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.9. <hi>For a great door and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual is opened unto mee, and there are many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.12. <hi>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Chriſts Goſpel, and a door was opened to mee of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Conſider that the quitting Gods way and will to ſhift difficulties, is the very way to plunge thy ſelf into the depth of difficulties. Jonah</hi> is brought into the uttermoſt danger, whilſt to ſhun danger, hee flyes from the <hi>Will of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>Make not the difficulty whatſoever it bee, bigger than it is.</hi> As wee <hi>ſuppoſe difficulties</hi> that are not, ſo wee ordinarily make thoſe few that are, <hi>much bigger</hi> in our repreſenting them to our ſelves, than the <hi>difficulties</hi> in themſelves are. Wee look upon our <hi>difficulties</hi> moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through a multiplying glaſs, and do in this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115823:44"/>caſe turn every mole-hill into a mountain, as in ſome others we turn mountains into mole-hills. Thus did the Spies, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.27. to the end. <hi>And they told him, and ſaid, wee came unto the land whither thou ſenteſt us, and ſurely it flows with milke and hony, and this is the fruit of it; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the people bee ſtrong that dwell in the land, and the Cities are walled, and very great, and moreover we ſaw the ſons of Anake there. The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South, and the Hittites, and the Jebuſites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains, and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea, and by the coaſt of Jordan. And Caleb ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the people before Moſes, and ſaid, Let us go up at once and poſſeſſe it, for wee are well able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it. But the men that went up with him, ſaid, Wee bee not able to go up againſt the people, for they are ſtronger than wee. And they brought up an evill report of the land which they had ſearched, unto the children of Iſrael, ſaying, The land through which wee have gone to ſearch it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof, and all the people that we ſaw in it, are men of a great ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And there we ſaw the Giants, the ſens of Anak, which come of the Giants; and we were in our own ſight as graſhoppers, and ſo we were in their ſight.</hi> A viſible <hi>difficulty</hi> there was, but how do they <hi>multiply</hi> it, and make a mountain of it, in giving in their report?</p>
                  <p n="6">6 <hi>Make a venture over the head of difficulties to Gods will where thou ſeeſt it, and truſt him in ſo doing for thy ſafety, tread thy difficulties, and truſt God to ſave thee from ſinking.</hi> Chriſt upon <hi>Peters</hi> deſire grants him liberty to come to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115823:45"/>him upon the water, <hi>Peter</hi> is <hi>ſinking,</hi> ſo ſoon as hee makes the <hi>venture,</hi> but Chriſt will not ſee him <hi>ſinke,</hi> for ſtreightway hee puts forth his hand, and ſaves him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.28. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Put caſe I am <hi>well ſatisfied</hi> as touching <hi>Gods will</hi> in a thing, but yet I finde my <hi>own will</hi> by ſome private intereſt, as pleaſure, honour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, love of friends, <hi>&amp;c. byaſſed another way,</hi> how, or by <hi>what means</hi> may the biaſſe of <hi>my will</hi> bee turned, and made to fall in with the <hi>will of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>Labour to finde out that particular thing that chiefly holds thy will upon the biaſſe from Gods will.</hi> Whether it bee thy pleaſure or profit, honour, friends, or ſuch like.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Having found it, then lay Gods will and that thing together, and then conſider with thy ſelf, which of theſe two is most honorable that I ſerve, or which have I moſt reaſon to ſerve?</hi> If it bee moſt honourable for thee, O my ſoul, or if thou haſt more reaſon ſo to do, to ſerve thy pleaſures than God, thy honours than God, thy profits than God, thy friends than God, and his will; then go on, O my ſoul, and ſo do: But if it bee more honourable for thee, or thou haſt more reaſon ſo to do to ſerve God, than theſe; then, O my ſoul, return, and give up thy ſelf to the <hi>will of God.</hi>
                  </p>

               <p n="2">2 That to every one beleeving on him hee ſhould give eternal life, verſ. 40. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and beleeveth on him, may have eternal

               <p>This <hi>will of God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of poor ſinners wee have alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7, 8, 9. <hi>Lo I come,</hi> here is the <hi>will of Chriſt, — to do thy will, O God,</hi> here is the <hi>will of the Father.</hi> When God ſaid, <hi>Sacrifice and offering I wil have no longer,</hi> theſe will never ſatisfie my juſtice, nor throughly ſave ſinners, whom I will have to bee ſaved, but I have prepared and fitted thee to bee a ſacrifice, then ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Lo I come;</hi> here am I Father, if ſacrifice and offering will not do it, here am I Father, take my blood, if that will do it, or puniſh mee as thou wilt, ſo that ſinner may bee ſaved.</p>
               <p>To this agree thoſe words of Chriſt to his Diſciples. <hi>Joh</hi> 4.34. <hi>My meat</hi> (here is the <hi>will of Chriſt</hi> ſhewed in his delight) <hi>is to do the will of him that ſent me;</hi> here is the <hi>will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> And upon what occaſion were theſe words ſpoken? why, upon occaſion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of a poor woman.</p>
               <p>To our purpoſe likewiſe are thoſe words of Chriſt ſpoken, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. in his laſt prayer to his Father, verſ 24. <hi>Father I will</hi> (here is the <hi>will of Chriſt</hi>) <hi>that thoſe whom thou haſt given me;</hi> here is the <hi>will of the Father:</hi> And very obſervable
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115823:53"/>it is, that as God the Father gave the Son a charge and command when hee went down to the earth, that of all thoſe which hee had given him hee ſhould loſe none. Now Jeſus Chriſt having done his work on earth, and throughly ſaved them, hee comes (as it were) in a way of commanding to his Father, as if hee ſhould ſay, O Righteous Father, you gave me a charge when I left heaven, that of all thoſe you had given mee, I ſhould loſe none, this command (O righteous Father) I have obeyed, and of thoſe which thou haſt given mee, I have loſt none: And now, O Father, I come to thee, and this is my will, which I will have to bee done, that thoſe whom thou haſt given mee, may bee with mee where I am.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſeem as it were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand each other, as though there were ſome <hi>unwillingneſſe</hi> in either, which is not ſo, there being nothing that the hearts of both breathe more earneſtly after, than the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of poor ſinners; but onely ſpeaking by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention to our capacities, to make us poor creatures ſenſible how <hi>exceeding willing</hi> they are to have poor ſinners ſaved, they ſpeak thus: The Father to ſhew his <hi>willingneſſe,</hi> layes a command upon Jeſus Chriſt, and doth (as it were) haſten him out of heaven about the work, though yet there was no need of this, it being the joy of his ſoul, and his very meat and drinke to ſave ſinners.</p>
               <p>The Son likewiſe to ſhew his <hi>willingneſſe,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done his work, hee doth as it were give
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115823:54"/>command to have heaven doores ſet open for poor ſinners to come in, though yet there was no need of this, heaven being prepared, and furniſhed by the Father on very purpoſe for them to come thither. But both to ſhew <hi>their willingneſſe</hi> and deſire of the thing, ſpeak thus; as alſo to confirm and ſtrengthen the faith of poor ſouls in coming to Chriſt. For ſuppoſe it ſhould bee (which never will bee) that there ſhould bee a time wherein the <hi>will of the Son</hi> ſhould decline the work of the ſalvation of poor ſinners, yet is the <hi>Fathers will</hi> ſo much in the thing, that hee would (as it were) lay a command upon the Son to do the work.</p>
               <p>And again, ſuppoſe it ſhould bee (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to all eternity will bee) that there ſhould bee a time wherein the <hi>Fathers will</hi> ſhould draw back, yet then the <hi>will of the Son</hi> is ſo much in this thing, that hee would (as it were, give mee leave with reverence ſo to ſpeak) lay a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand upon the <hi>Fathers will,</hi> to bring it up to the thing. The Holy Ghoſt uſing this manner of ſpeaking, not as though there were or ever would bee any ſuch thing, that either the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Son ſhould be <hi>unwilling,</hi> but onely to ſpeak to our capacity, who being poor finite creatures, can no way conceive of theſe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite myſteries of the Goſpel, but as they are by a certaine kinde of periphraſis, or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locution of ſpeaking (making us by ſeverall things and words to underſtand ſomething of one thing) unfolded to us, it expreſſeth it ſelfe after this manner.</p>

Yea God the Father hath not onely <hi>willed</hi> the thing, but given Chriſt an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command</hi> to go about the buſineſs, which is ſomewhat more than <hi>bare willing;</hi> I may <hi>will</hi> a thing to bee done, and that ſuch a one ſhould do it, and yet not preſently give an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command</hi> for the doing of it. This <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> wee have <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. where Chriſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his care and love towards his ſheep, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in his knowing, owning of them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them, bringing them to his fold, and laying down his life for them, concludes all with this, <hi>This commandement have I received of my Father.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, It is my Fathers <hi>Commandement</hi> that I ſhould take care of, own my ſheep, bring them into the fold, dye for them. Now this <hi>will</hi> and <hi>command</hi> of the Father, it cannot but have <hi>ſpecial influence</hi> upon
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115823:58"/>Jeſus Chriſt to make him <hi>willing</hi> to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, eſpecially it we do but conſider two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That this command of the Father, it was a <hi>ſpecial command</hi> given to Chriſt as hee was <hi>Mediator,</hi> or as he was our <hi>ſecond Adam.</hi> As the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> had one <hi>ſpecial command</hi> (over and above the Moral Law which was written in his heart in his firſt Creation) <hi>viz.</hi> of not eating the forbidden fruit, which was given him (as godly men ſpeak) over and beſides all the ten Commandements, to bee a trial, a ſigne or ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole of his obedience to all the reſt, ſo as that by his eating, or not eating of the forbidden fruit, God would judge of all his other obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. So this command of dying to ſave ſinners, it was a <hi>ſpecial Law</hi> given to Chriſt as <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> (over, and above the Moral Law) which is common to him and us) to be as a ſign or ſymbole of his obedience to all Gods other commands; ſo that had Chriſt failed here, God would have accounted him obedient in nothing: Yea God the Father layes this upon Chriſt, that look as hee did expect his love, hee ſhould bee mindful to perform this his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and therefore from his obedience here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, hee comforts himſelf in his Fathers love, that hee did love him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17, 18. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth my Father love mee, becauſe I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it from mee, but I lay it down of my ſelfe; have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again: This Commandement have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of my Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 That this will or command of the Father,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115823:59"/>it remains, and is infull force <hi>even to the laſt day,</hi> ſo long as there are any poor ſinners whom the Father hath given to Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaved, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39, 40. <hi>And this is the Fathers will which hath ſent me, that of all which hee hath given mee, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day. And this is the will of him that ſent mee, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and beleeveth on him, may have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life; and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Chriſt cannot quit himſelf of this <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> untill the <hi>laſt day,</hi> till ſuch time as hee hath brought all thoſe ſouls whom the Father will have to bee ſaved, into Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe not onely his Fathers command, but his own intereſt is much ingaged in the ſalvation of ſinners, and therefore hee muſt needs bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> Every one is <hi>willing</hi> with that wherein his own <hi>intereſt</hi> lyes.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The intereſt of his <hi>honour and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> hee ſhould loſe much of his <hi>honour</hi> ſhould not ſinners bee ſaved: It is a <hi>diſhonour</hi> to take a work in hand, and not go through with it, it argues either want of ability, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs; Chriſt hath taken the work in hand. There is a twofold <hi>glory</hi> that Chriſt hath, a <hi>Perſonal glory,</hi> and a <hi>Mediatory glory,</hi> which undoubtedly is, and ſhall bee a very great <hi>addition</hi> to Chriſts <hi>perſonal glory,</hi> of which Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.10. <hi>And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.</hi> As a Prince may have a twofold glory by noble birth, and noble atchievements, and the latter is a great addition to the former. Now
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115823:59"/>though Chriſt ſhould have his <hi>perſonal glory,</hi> though ſinners ſhould never bee ſaved, yet his <hi>glory</hi> as <hi>Mediator,</hi> that ſhould bee loſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Of his <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> Chriſt takes abundance of <hi>pleaſure</hi> in the ſalvation of ſinners, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30, 31. <hi>Then was I by him as one brought up with him; and I was daily his delight, rejoycing alwayes before him, rejoycing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights were with the ſons of men.</hi> Joh. 4.34. <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that ſent mee, and to finiſh his worke,</hi> Luke 10.21. <hi>In that houre Jeſus rejoyced in Spirit, and ſaid, I thanke thee O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes, even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight;</hi> compared with 17. and 18. verſes, <hi>And the ſeventy returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with joy, ſaying, Lord, even the Devils are ſubject unto us through thy Name, and hee ſaid unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.</hi> Now ſhould hee not bee <hi>willing</hi> to ſave them, all this ſhould bee loſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Of his <hi>gain,</hi> this ſhould bee loſt, ſhould hee not bee <hi>willing</hi> to ſave ſinners, becauſe Chriſt can put his death to no other uſe: For a man to give much for a thing, which can bee put but to one uſe, and when hee hath it, not to put it to that uſe, but reſolve the contrary, is to throw his mony on the Dung-hill. Now Chriſt can put his blood to no other uſe; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee laid out for the uſe of Angels, becauſe it was a ſacrifice offered up in anothers nature, and not in theirs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. <hi>For verily hee tooke
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115823:60"/>not on him the nature of Angels, but hee took on him the ſeed of Abraham;</hi> yea the good Angels, though they are confirmed by Chriſt, yet is it not by Chriſt as Mediator, but by Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal mediation. Chriſt is head of Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Powers, but not as hee is Mediator, ſo onely hee is head of the Church, but as hee is the ſecond perſon, ſhould Chriſt bee head to them as Mediator, there would bee no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt Chriſt being a head to Angels and men. And as for the bad Angels, they are excluded from it; ſo that Chriſts blood can bee put to no other uſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Of his <hi>Fathers love;</hi> for his Fathers love ſeems to bee linked to his obedience in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17, 18. <hi>Therefore doth my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love mee, becauſe I lay down my life, that I might take it again, &amp;c.</hi> — <hi>This Commandement have I received of my Father.</hi> Theſe four things wherein chiefly mens intereſſes do lye, <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>credit, honour, or advancement,</hi> their <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, profit,</hi> and <hi>love of friends,</hi> Chriſt ſhould loſe all theſe, ſhould hee not bee <hi>willing</hi> that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould bee ſaved.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Becauſe the ſeveral offices of Chriſt would bee in a great part fruſtrated, ſhould not Chriſt bee willing to have poor ſinners ſaved.</hi> As for the <hi>Prophetical office,</hi> what uſe would there bee of his teaching, either outwardly by ſending forth Meſſengers and Ambaſſadors, or inwardly by his Spirit, were hee not <hi>willing</hi> ſinners ſhould bee ſaved, except it were to aggravate mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation onely. For the <hi>Prieſtly office,</hi> what uſe would there bee of Chriſts ſacrifice of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115823:60"/>blood on earth, or interceſſion in heaven, were hee not <hi>willing</hi> ſinners ſhould bee ſaved: Yea what need had there been of this, had not Chriſt been <hi>willing?</hi> hee might have ſpared all his labour and coſt below, and work above too, had it not been for this. For the <hi>Kingly office,</hi> what uſe would there bee of Chriſts reigning in his Churches, in the hearts of his people, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying their ſins, quickning their graces, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ruling of them, were hee not <hi>willing</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould bee ſaved? all that part of his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office,</hi> which is exerciſed with his Scepter of love, would bee uſeleſſe. So that the <hi>Offices</hi> of Chriſt would bee almoſt wholly fruſtrated, were not Chriſt <hi>willing</hi> ſinners ſhould bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Now do but conſider, what <hi>great in flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> this muſt needs have upon Chriſt to make him <hi>willing,</hi> for,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Hee is put into his Offices by his Father; Firſt, made a Prophet by God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, conſider the Apoſtle and high Prieſt of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Secondly, A Prieſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5, 6. <hi>So alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelf to bee made an high Prieſt, but hee that ſaid unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. As hee ſaith alſo in another place, Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedec.</hi> Thirdly, A King, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6, <hi>Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 His Father hath fitted him for theſe. To bee a Prophet, hee hath given him a tongue, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.4. <hi>The Lord God hath given mee the tongue of the learned, that I ſhould know how to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115823:61"/>ſpeake a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary.</hi> To bee a Prieſt, hee hath given him a body, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou wouldeſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared mee.</hi> To bee a King, hee hath given him a Scepter, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing, and a Throne, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45 6, 7. <hi>Thy Throne (O God) is for ever and ever; the Scepter of thy Kingdome is a right Scepter; thou lovest righteouſneſſe, and hateſt wickedneſſe; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oyle of gladneſſe above thy fellows.</hi> Now ſhould Chriſt after all this bee <hi>unwilling</hi> to ſave ſinners, this would highly diſpleaſe the Father.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Chriſt hath accepted of theſe Offices; to take an Office, and never intend to performe it, is high deceit: Now ſhould not Chriſt bee <hi>willing</hi> to ſave ſinners, hee ſhould do thus. The ſaving of ſinners, is the very end of all theſe Offices.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Becauſe the ſundry Relations that Chriſt ſtands in unto poor ſinners, makes him willing, yea argues hee muſt needs bee ſo, that poor ſinners ſhould bee ſaved?</hi> When I ſay Chriſt ſtands in <hi>Relation</hi> to ſinners, I do not mean that they are to be looked upon as ſinners, as they ſtand in that <hi>Relation,</hi> but Chriſt ſtands in <hi>Relation</hi> to them, who are in themſelves ſinners. There are <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Relations</hi> betwixt Chriſt and his people, as of a brother and brother, Maſter and ſervant, Father and children, Husband and wife, King and ſubjects, Head and members. Now theſe <hi>Relations</hi> cannot but much engage the heart of Chriſt to bee <hi>willing</hi> to ſave ſinners, if wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:115823:61"/>
               <p n="1">1 How that <hi>Relation it ſelfe</hi> is a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getter and knitter of affections; what begets ſuch affection betwixt Father and childe, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife? <hi>Relation:</hi> And from hence the parties related are made to wiſh and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the good of each other.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That Chriſt ſtands <hi>in all theſe Relations:</hi> Hee is Maſter, King, Brother, Father, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Head, all theſe: If to bee but in one of theſe <hi>Relations,</hi> as a Father, or Husband, make a man ſo <hi>willing</hi> and induſtrious of the good of the party related to, then much more to bee in all: Now Chriſt is in all, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but bee <hi>exceeding willing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 That theſe <hi>Relations can never bee broken:</hi> Earthly <hi>Relations</hi> may bee, and are diſſolved, they are knots death unties; But now the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> betwixt Chriſt, and his (poor ſinful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) can never bee broken; and therefore if Chriſt once ſtood related to them, and thereby became <hi>willing</hi> to have them ſaved, hee muſt of neceſſity be ſo for ever, becauſe this <hi>Relation</hi> holds for ever:</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Becauſe Chriſt having taken our nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, makes him that hee is, and hee muſt needs bee willing to have poor ſinners ſaved,</hi> if wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 That Chriſt took our nature upon him for this <hi>as one main end,</hi> that hee might bee made a merciful High Prieſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that hee might bee a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and faithful High Prieſt, in things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115823:62"/>people.</hi> Chriſt as God was <hi>merciful</hi> before, but his taking our nature makes him merciful as <hi>man,</hi> as well as God, and <hi>willing</hi> to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</item>
                  <item>2 No ſooner had Chriſt taken our nature, but preſently there was a <hi>merciful diſpoſition</hi> wrought in him, or an inclination to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5.7. <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou wouldeſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared mee; then ſaid I, Lo, I come, in the volume of the book it is written of mee, to do thy will, O God.</hi> No ſooner hath Chriſt a body prepared, but hee hath a <hi>will</hi> and <hi>inclination</hi> to ſave ſinners.</item>
                  <item>This merciful diſpoſition, or inclination of his heart to ſave ſinners, it is now <hi>natural to him as hee is man,</hi> as well as God. Now things which are <hi>natural</hi> to us, wee cannot but bee <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding willing</hi> and inclinable to do, <hi>nature</hi> is ſuch a drawer. This wee may ſee if wee do but compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Then ſaid I, Lo, I come, to do thy will, O God,</hi> with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7, 8. <hi>Then ſaid I, Lo, I come: I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy Law is within my heart.</hi> Where this <hi>will</hi> of God to ſave ſinners, is ſaid to bee a <hi>Law within his heart.</hi>

You cannot draw an univerſal propoſition from an indefinite, becauſe the univerſal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in one is taken univerſally, but not ſo in the other. Now when I ſay it is the will of <hi>God and Chriſt that ſinners</hi> ſhould bee ſaved, I ſpeak of <hi>ſinners indefinitly,</hi> not <hi>univerſally.</hi> Yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Scripture ſpeaks expreſly, that it is the <hi>will of God</hi> that ſome ſinners ſhould <hi>not</hi> bee ſaved, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18, 19. <hi>Therefore hath hee mercy on whom hee will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. Thou wilt ſay then unto me, why doth hee yet finde fault? for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> Where the Apoſtle (verſ. 18.) makes the <hi>hardening</hi> of ſinners unto damnation to bee as well the <hi>will of God,</hi> as the ſhewing of <hi>mercy</hi> to ſalvation; yea in propounding the Cavillers objection, verſ. 19. hee plainly implies this, in thoſe words, <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is the <hi>will of God</hi> that ſome ſhould bee <hi>hardened.</hi> Therefore, I ſay, though it bee the <hi>will of God and Chriſt</hi> that ſinners ſhould bee ſaved, yet is it <hi>not the will of God</hi> that all ſinners ſhould, but the contrary is the <hi>wil of God,</hi> that ſome ſinners ſhould go on and bee <hi>hardened</hi> in their ſins, and ſo periſh eternally. But when the Scripture ſpeaks of ſinners indefinitly, it is (as I have ſaid) to notifie the condition that thoſe perſons are in, <hi>viz.</hi> in a condition of ſin and miſery, but not (as I have ſometime ſince ſhewed) to ſignifie that all ſinners ſhould bee ſaved, or that it is the <hi>will of God</hi> it ſhould bee ſo; perſons in ſuch a condition are thoſe God will ſave, but not all in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Come therefore, O poor ſoul, and rowl thy ſelf into the Armes of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: If a meſſenger ſhould come from the Prince unto a company of beggars, and tell them that the Prince is <hi>willing</hi> that poor beggars ſhould come to him, and hee will give entertainment to all that come, there needs bee no more arguments uſed to draw them flocking to his door; they would not ſtand objecting and querying, but will hee entertaine mee and mee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Behold the Lord of heaven is <hi>willing</hi> to entertaine ſinners; do not now ſtand querying; but is hee <hi>willing</hi> to entertaine me and me; No, but come, make a venture, as beggars in ſuch a caſe will, whether you ſpeed or no: Haſt thou been a drunken Sot, a renter of the holy name of God, an unclean perſon, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaner of the Ordinances of God theſe many years together: O poor ſoul, make a venture for heaven once before thou dyeſt; Come, come, come, Coming is thy duty, receiving of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115823:64"/>comers is that which God hath promiſed, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thou upon that which is thy duty, and leave thou God to fulfill his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>Haſt thou been a great ſinner, and doth this make thee afraid to come? Conſider who they are that Chriſt invites to his wedding Supper; why, high-way men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.9, 10. <hi>Go yee therefore into the high-wayes, and as many as yee ſhall finde, bid to the marriage.</hi> So thoſe ſervants went out into the <hi>high-wayes</hi> and gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all as many as they found, both bad and good, and the wedding was furniſhed with gueſts. Now who are they which uſually fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the <hi>high-wayes,</hi> why <hi>beggars</hi> and <hi>blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and <hi>lame-men,</hi> and <hi>Theeves,</hi> and <hi>Robbers,</hi> and <hi>Murderers,</hi> ſuch they are that Chriſt invites, the <hi>worſt of ſinners.</hi> When Chriſt paſſed through <hi>Jericho,</hi> and was crouded and thronged with a company of holy devout perſons, Chriſt looks over all theſe, and ſpies out one <hi>Zacheus</hi> a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, a notorious ſinner, an extortioner, and him Chriſt imbraceth and layeth hold of. Come poor ſoul, though thou haſt been as vile as the vileſt, yet Chriſt will imbrace thee coming to him. Read over the Promiſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth mee, ſhal come to mee, and him that cometh to mee, I wil in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Chriſt is <hi>willing</hi> poor ſinners ſhould come, bee thou, O ſinner, <hi>willing</hi> to come: As bee is a <hi>willing</hi> Saviour, ſo ſhould wee bee a <hi>willing</hi> people, and who would not bee <hi>willing</hi> to bee ſaved, when God and Chriſt are <hi>willing</hi> to ſave. As the father of the Prodigal met his Son com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115823:65"/>ſo Chriſt will meet thy ſoul above halfe way. In a word, if thou wilt not come thou wilt bee damned for ever; <hi>There is no other name under heaven given among men whereby thou canſt bee ſaved, but by the name of Chriſt. Hee that beleeveth on him</hi> (which is the coming I ſpeak of) <hi>ſhall bee ſaved, but hee that beleeveth not ſhall bee damned.</hi>

                  <p>Obj. <hi>But how can the Law in Equity and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice paſſe an actual Sentence upon a man, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his coming into the World is juſtified in his common perſon?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though a Saint be <hi>juſtified</hi> long before in Chriſt, yet the Law may paſs an <hi>actual Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation</hi> upon him notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this, becauſe though in Chriſt he be <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> yet he is not <hi>abſolved</hi> until ſuch time as he hath his particular Pardon, as for example; A company of Perſons for Rebellion againſt their Soveraigne are <hi>actually</hi> proclaimed Traytors, and if taken, are by the Law adjudged to dye; the young Prince deſirous to ſave the lives of ſome of theſe, gives his Father a <hi>Ranſome</hi> for them; the perſons <hi>ranſomed</hi> known only to the Prince, and his Father are now pardoned,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115823:68"/>and ſo eſteemed in ſight of the Prince and his Father, yet becauſe the names of theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are concealed, and it is a ſecret to whom this belongs the Law therefore (which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not upon <hi>ſecret,</hi> but <hi>knowne</hi> grounds) takes no cognizance thereof, but (though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them be <hi>juſtified,</hi> and the Princes Son hath a general Pardon in his hand for them, yet in regard the particular Pardons are not given forth) the Law (not acknowledging them pardoned, becauſe in a Legal way they are not) followes the general <hi>Sentence</hi> upon all without exception, until ſuch time as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Pardon is produced, and then as each hath his particular Pardon produced, ſo the Law <hi>actually</hi> acquits him, and not before. This is the Compariſon, the Application is, In <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s Fall we all were proclaimed Traytors, and adjudged to dye; Chriſt willing to ſave a certaine number of theſe condemned perſons, gives his life a <hi>ranſome</hi> for them, which God accepts and hereupon Chriſt hath a general Pardon given to him, by vertue of which all theſe perſons (conſidered in the Lump, as in him their common Perſon) are pardoned; yet becauſe it is a <hi>ſecret</hi> known to God and Chriſt alone, who they are which are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Law of God therefore, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not upon <hi>ſecret,</hi> but <hi>manifeſt</hi> things, takes no notice of this, but followes the <hi>general Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> of <hi>Condemnation</hi> upon all, until ſuch time as each one hath a particular Pardon drawne out of the general given an applied to him; ſo that a man may <hi>vertually</hi> be <hi>juſtified</hi> in Chriſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115823:68"/>as his common Perſon, and yet juſtly under an <hi>actual ſentence</hi> of <hi>Condemnation</hi> from the Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 From the <hi>effects of that Sentence,</hi> viz. <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments</hi> here on Soul and Body, as they flow from Divine Wrath, and are for the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> not that Souls in Chriſt are <hi>freed</hi> from all ſufferings in Soul and Body, for they ſuffer through <hi>Adams</hi> Fall in both as well as others: but theſe their ſufferings are Fatherly Chaſtiſements, not legal <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> inflicted out of wrath to ſatisfie <hi>Juſtice,</hi> which for them is already by Chriſt ſatisfied; yea, Death it ſelf which they with others ſuffer, is not a Legal <hi>puniſhment,</hi> but a tranſlation to a better life. Now, <hi>puniſhments</hi> are the <hi>effects</hi> of this <hi>Sentence,</hi> only as they are Legal <hi>puniſhments,</hi> all which they are <hi>freed</hi> from, and ſo from all the <hi>effects</hi> of this <hi>Sentence.</hi>

                  <p>But ſecondly, and <hi>POSITIVELY, Our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is through the righteouſneſs of Chriſt the new Adam,</hi> Rom. 3.20, 21, 22. chap. 5.18, 19. which righteouſneſs is two-fold, <hi>Active, Paſſive;</hi> the <hi>Active</hi> gives us Title to <hi>glory,</hi> the <hi>Paſſive</hi> frees us from <hi>condemnation;</hi> as our Juſtification to life eternal hath reſpect to Chriſts <hi>active</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſo our juſtification from death eternal hath reſpect to his <hi>paſſive,</hi> Rom. 5.10. Chriſts <hi>Paſſive</hi> obedience, <hi>viz.</hi> his death and ſufferings, is that <hi>frees us</hi> from <hi>condemnation;</hi> for herein hee bare the curſe of the Law, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for us. So that all the <hi>free dome</hi> poor ſouls have, from that guilt which is brought in by ſin, and the conſequence thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation</hi> here, with its <hi>effects,</hi> and the <hi>final execution</hi> thereof hereafter, is by the death of Chriſt, his blood, his <hi>paſſive</hi> obedience, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5.</p>
                  <p>Hence theſe, and ſuch like Scriptures which attribute juſtification to the blood, death, and ſufferings of Chriſt, ſpeak not of juſtification fully, but onely of a part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification from death eternal.</p>
                  <p>Hence alſo wee learn how exceedingly every Saint is <hi>beholding</hi> to Chriſt for <hi>dying,</hi> for had hee not <hi>dyed,</hi> wee had been all to this very day under the fearful <hi>ſentence of condemnation</hi> with all the <hi>effects</hi> thereof, and ſhould have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>final execution</hi> thereof for ever in hell hereafter; and alſo for fulfilling the Law of God <hi>actively</hi> for him, which had hee not done, though his death ſhoud have <hi>freed</hi> him from
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115823:70"/>hell, yet could hee not have had an <hi>entrance</hi> into Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 But wherein doth it appear that this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from condemnation, is ſuch a great and glorious priviledge?</p>

Is it not a great and glorious privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>for a man to have all his accuſers mouths ſtopped?</hi> This is the priviledge of thoſe who are <hi>freed</hi> from <hi>condemnation:</hi> Suppoſe a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor under <hi>ſentence</hi> hath a <hi>pardon,</hi> that very act <hi>ſtops</hi> all his accuſers mouthes, as to that thing for which hee was <hi>condemned.</hi> So the act of Gods <hi>pardoning grace ſtops</hi> ſins mouth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences mouth, the Devils mouth. As there can bee no legal <hi>condemnation,</hi> without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent accuſation; ſo there can bee no accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as touching things remitted, after pardon.

Are not his ſins <hi>pardoned?</hi> Why then Satan doeſt thou rake up theſe old buſineſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Is it not a great and glorious priviledge <hi>to bee freed from that which to bee under, would make one unſpeakably miſerable for ever?</hi> Soules <hi>freed</hi> from <hi>condemnation</hi> are ſo; under <hi>condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and under the <hi>wrath</hi> of God, which burnes like devouring flames of fire.

There is a paſſage from death to life, but none back again.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Is it not a great priviledge, <hi>to bee in ſuch a condition, wherein I can triumph over all my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſpiritual and temporal?</hi> Soules <hi>freed</hi> from <hi>condemnation</hi> are in this condition; they can <hi>triumph</hi> over ſin, becauſe they ſee the guilt thereof taken away, and have the promiſe and ſtrength of Chriſt to mortifie it in them; over the <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe the <hi>curſe</hi> is gone, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. over the <hi>Devil,</hi> becauſe they ſee <hi>principalities and powers</hi> ſpoyled; over <hi>death,</hi> becauſe its but an <hi>entrance</hi> into life, and ſo far as there is <hi>evil</hi> in it, its ſwallowed up into <hi>victory;</hi> over <hi>hell,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt hath delivered them from <hi>wrath</hi> to come; over the <hi>malice, reproaches, contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> of the world, becauſe Chriſt hath <hi>overcome</hi>

                  <p n="6">6 Is it not a great and glorious priviledge <hi>to have a ſhare and propriety in all that is Chriſts?</hi> this is their's: they are heirs of God, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heires with Chriſt; and ſo Chriſts life, death, riches, wiſdome, righteouſneſs, ſtrength, grace, glory, all is theirs.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Is it not a great and glorious priviledge, <hi>to have all our afflictions and croſſes turned into bleſſings and mercies?</hi> This alſo is their's; they meet with no <hi>affliction</hi> but it is a <hi>mercy</hi> to them; if in poverty, their poverty is a <hi>mercy;</hi> if in ſickneſs, if in temptation, under reproach, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der loſſes, yea death it ſelf, yet it is a <hi>mercy.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is one thing to bee under the power of Satan by way of <hi>Divine permiſſion,</hi> God permitting Satan to have a power over thee; another, by way of <hi>voluntary ſubjection,</hi> Chriſt was under the power of Satan by way of <hi>Divine permiſſion</hi> when his body by Satan was tranſported from place to place.

It is one thing to have the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin removed which brings under <hi>condemnation,</hi> and another to have the being and <hi>acting</hi> of ſin removed; <hi>Paul</hi> had the <hi>guilt</hi> removed, yet not the <hi>being</hi> or <hi>acting,</hi> Rom. 7.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is a difference betwixt the <hi>having</hi> of life, and the <hi>feeling</hi> of it; do not ſay, becauſe thou doeſt not <hi>feel</hi> life, therefore thou <hi>haſt</hi> none.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Thy feeling the <hi>contrary,</hi> to wit, a want of life, argues thou haſt it, for a dead man feels nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. See then what a <hi>vaſt difference there is betwixt the condition of one that hath intereſt in Chriſt, and another mans;</hi> the one <hi>is freed from condemnation,</hi> the other is <hi>under it.</hi> There is as much <hi>difference,</hi> as is betwixt one man going up the gallowes to bee hanged, and another go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the gallows with a pardon in his hand to the Court, there to ſit at the Princes Table.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>How bleſſed then is the condition of every ſoul intereſſed in Chriſt!</hi> Such are <hi>freed from condemnation.

A
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115823:73"/>man when frantick, or mad, though <hi>condemned</hi> to dye, yet hee thinks his condition as good as the beſt; but when hee comes to himſelf, and ſees where hee is, then hee cryes out, O that I were in the condition of ſuch a one, and ſuch a one. So when men are mad after their luſts, and beſotted with them, they think their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition good, though under a <hi>ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;</hi> but when ſuch ſhall at the houre of death, or judgement come to themſelves, and ſee where they are, then ſhall they cry out, O that I were in ſuch a ones condition, and ſuch a ones. <hi>Balaam</hi> when hee came to dye, would dye the <hi>death of the righteous.</hi> So when men come to dye, O then that I were ſuch a one; whom if they could they would have hanged while they lived.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Then how great a ſin, and how much below their condition, is unbeleef in the people of God?</hi> Soul, hath Chriſt <hi>freed</hi> thee from <hi>condemnation,</hi> and wilt thou <hi>diſtruſt</hi> him for ſalvation? And doth Chriſt ſay as much to thee, and wilt thou by <hi>unbeleefe</hi> give Chriſt the lye? Deale not thus, O ſoule, by thy loving Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 This <hi>caſts many perſons, and brings moſt men in the Countries, Towns, and Pariſhes of the world, under condemnation:</hi> Why? they have not intereſt in Chriſt, and ſuch, and onely ſuch are <hi>freed,</hi> therefore all others are <hi>under</hi> it ſtill.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Art thou one who liveſt and walkeſt in prophane courſes, a Drunkard, Swearer, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean perſon, &amp;c. thou art one caſt by this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; for as yet thou haſt not intereſt in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6. <hi>If wee ſay that wee have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115823:73"/>with him, and walke in darkneſs, wee lye, and do not the truth.</hi> If ſuch have not <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with Chriſt, then no <hi>actual intereſt</hi> in him; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion flows from union, if it bee a <hi>lye</hi> to ſay they have communion, much more to ſay they have <hi>actual intereſt,</hi> and conſequently union.</p>

Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, many of them did excel in Morality, yet knew not Chriſt. The Scribes and Phariſees came behinde none of our Moraliſts, yet hear what Chriſt ſaith to them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.20. <hi>For I ſay unto you, that except your righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, yee ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi>

Art thou a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſinner, a perſecutor? read 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief.</hi> Mark. 3.28. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, All ſins ſhall bee forgiven unto the ſons of men, and blaſphemies, wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they ſhall blaſpheme.</hi> Art thou a moral man? ſo was <hi>Nicodemus, Joh.</hi> 3.

                  <p n="2">2 <hi>If Saints are renewed after the Image of Chriſt, then have they in-being in Christ;</hi> no <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing</hi> by Chriſt, but from <hi>in-being</hi> in Chriſt; no depravation but from our union with the old <hi>Adam,</hi> no renovation but through our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the new <hi>Adam.</hi> But Saints are <hi>renewed</hi> after the Image of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. Beleevers are ſaid to be <hi>renewed in knowledge after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of him that created him,</hi> i.e. after the Image of Chriſt.

                  <p n="3">3 <hi>If Saints may lay claime to Chriſt, and what is Chriſts, as their owne and proper right, then have they in-being in Chriſt;</hi> for in things of this nature, <hi>propriety,</hi> whereby I may challenge a thing for my owne, comes from <hi>poſſeſſion;</hi> no <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> no laying claime to a <hi>propriety.</hi> But Saints may lay claime to Chriſt, and what is in Chriſt as their owne, they may lay claime to Chriſts Wiſdome, Riches, Righteouſneſs, Strength, Grace, Glory, and all as theirs, and therefore they have <hi>in-being</hi> in Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is a <hi>Three-fold in-being</hi> in Chriſt that Saints have.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 A <hi>Vertual in-being</hi> in Chriſt, as Chriſt is the common Perſon, or repreſentative of all Gods Elect, and this comes meerly from Gods Election, there being no other reaſon of it; God hath elected them to Salvation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath given them to Chriſt, who is become their common perſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 A <hi>myſtical in-being</hi> in Chriſt, as Saints are members of that true Spiritual inviſible Body whereof Chriſt is head; this comes chiefly from regeneration.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 An <hi>actual in-being</hi> in Chriſt (not but that the former which I terme <hi>myſtical,</hi> is <hi>actuall</hi> too, but I <hi>distinguiſh</hi> it from that, becauſe that is ſuch an <hi>in-being</hi> as chiefly tends to make the Body of Chriſt perfect, this is ſuch an <hi>in-being</hi> as doth chiefly tend to the making of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons perfect in him) whereby every Saint in particular hath <hi>actual union</hi> with Chriſt, and is <hi>actually</hi> in this bleſſed Perſon of the Lord Jeſus, and by <hi>being in</hi> him made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and <hi>actually juſtified</hi> from all ſin; now this is through faith and regeneration.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>But have not Saints actual union before Faith, is Union the fruite of faith, or faith of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:115823:77"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Actual union is Two fold, either Chriſts <hi>actual uniting</hi> himſelf to us, or out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>actually united</hi> to Chriſt; <hi>You in me, I in you;</hi> there is an <hi>actual union</hi> on Chriſts part, and on our part. <hi>Actual union</hi> on Chriſts part, that is <hi>before beleeving,</hi> and is then effected, when Chriſt firſt comes into us by his Spirit to draw us to his Father, and this is wrought precedent to any good in us, and all good comes from this: <hi>Actual union</hi> on our part, that is <hi>by beleeving;</hi> and is then effected when I am ſaid to come to Chriſt, and the Father by him. As in our Reconciliation, there is Gods Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to us, and ours to God ſpoken of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. <hi>And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given to us the miniſtry of reconciliation, to wit, that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation; Now then, we are Ambaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be yee reconciled to God.</hi> God's reconciliation to us, that is, <hi>before faith,</hi> before ever we heare a word of faith, and that by Chriſts offering up himſelf to his Father; our reconciliation to God, that is, <hi>by beleeving,</hi> when wee heare and embrace the word of reconciliation. So Chriſts <hi>union</hi> to us, that is, <hi>before faith,</hi> and doth not at all depend upon our beleeving as any fruit thereof, but rather our beleeving flowes from thence. We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt; wee are <hi>actually united</hi> to him, becauſe hee is <hi>acutally
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115823:77"/>united</hi> to us firſt; but now our <hi>union with Chriſt,</hi> that is, <hi>by beleeving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 That by in-being in Chriſt, Saints <hi>are freed</hi> from Condemnation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>That which removes all our ſins from us, frees us from condemnation,</hi> for no ſin, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; but <hi>in-being</hi> in Chriſt removes all our ſins from us, it takes ſin from our backs, and laies it, upon the back of Chriſt. Sins are debts, the debts that we owe to God, all theſe debts after once we come to have marriage-u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt, are transferred over to him, ſo that they are no longer our debts, but his debts; neither are we now liable to pay them, but he muſt anſwer for them, and ſee Gods Juſtice ſatisfied, and the Debt-book croſſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>That which gives us a right and title to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that frees us from condemnation,</hi> but out <hi>in-being</hi> in Chriſt doth this; for by vertue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are Gods Heirs, yea joynt-heirs with Chriſt, and ſo have as true a title, though not ſo large a title to Glory and Salvation as Chriſt himſelf hath; though wee have not for the preſent actual poſſeſſion, yet our title is good, firme and certaine; as an Heire in Minority hath not actual poſſeſſion, yet his title is as good as afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>That which makes voyd and null all impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and charges whatſoever, frees us from condemnation,</hi> but this doth our <hi>in-being</hi> in Chriſt; for being in Chriſt no charge or <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment</hi> can be drawne againſt us, but the ſame hath been drawne againſt Chriſt in our ſtead, and he hath anſwered the ſame at the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115823:78"/>Bar of Gods Juſtice, and is come off clear and acquitted. So that now all <hi>impeachments and charges</hi> are voyd and null, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth? it is Christ that dyed, yea rather that is riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 And laſtly, <hi>That which makers the Law, Jury, and Judge of a mans ſide, frees him from condemnation;</hi> but this doth our <hi>in-being</hi> in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It makes the <hi>Law</hi> of our ſide, for the <hi>Law</hi> it is a rule of Juſtice and Equity, it requires equity ſhould be done to every one, now it would not be equity to take ſatisfaction, and not to acquit the Party for whom it hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it; now the <hi>Law</hi> hath taken ſatisfaction for all that are in Chriſt, and therefore the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the <hi>Law</hi> requires they ſhould be abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the ſentence of condemnation; ſo that the <hi>Law</hi> is of the ſide of thoſe perſons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It make the <hi>Jury of Conſcience</hi> of a mans ſide, for ſaith <hi>Conſcience,</hi> doth the caſe lye thus, that I am in Chriſt, then not guilty, not guilty; though once I was guilty, yet Chriſt hath taken the guilt away, and therefore now not guilty, not guilty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It makes the <hi>Judge</hi> of a mans ſide, for ſaith God the <hi>Judge,</hi> is it ſo that this party is in my Son Chriſt, then is he a member of my Son, then is he married to my Son, and I am a Friend to all ſuch for my Sons ſake, for what hee hath done and ſuffered, I own, love,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115823:78"/>and reſpect, and therefore hee ſhall never bee condemned.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>But I fear I have no in-being in Jeſus Chriſt, for ſurely had I in-being in Chriſt, I ſhould grow and thrive more than I doe, living Branches in the Vine grow, and certainly were I a living Branch in Chriſt, I ſhould grow more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thy doubt poor Soul is, thou <hi>doſt not grow,</hi> what <hi>growth</hi> is that thou lookeſt for? is it <hi>growth of gifts</hi> only, or is it <hi>growth of grace?</hi> doth thy doubt ariſe hence becauſe thou canſt not pray, talk of Divine things, open and explains Scriptures as another can; or becauſe thou art not ſo humble, mortified, ſelf-denying, conformable in all things and conditions to the will of God, as thou ſeeſt another Saint is? If thy doubt ariſe becauſe thou haſt not ſuch gifts, then let me tell thee, that as <hi>gifts</hi> of themſelves, though a man did ever ſo excel in them, are no evidence of a mans being in Chriſt (though a man had the <hi>gifts</hi> of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel yet no evidence, for herein hee hath no more than the Devil hath, who is an Angel) ſo the want of <hi>gifts;</hi> if this bee all thy doubt, doth not at all evidence the contrary; I pray, what excellency of <hi>gifts</hi> are there in Babes and Sucklings, in compariſon of the gifts of the wiſe and prudent, and yet Babes and Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are in Chriſt, when the wiſe and prudent are not? What <hi>gifts</hi> in the fooliſh things of the world, and baſe things, and things that are not, <hi>i.e.</hi> of no account at all in the eye and eſteeme of man? and yet theſe hath God
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115823:79"/>choſen, and they are in Chriſt, who of God is made unto them, wiſdome, &amp;c. When the wiſe things of the world, and the Scribes and diſputers of the world are ſet by, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28, 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith the ſoul) <hi>my doubt is not ſo much about gifts, as grace, I do not finde my ſelf to grow in grace, in humility, mortification, &amp;c. and this begets all my fear.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1 There is a <hi>twofold growth,</hi> a growth in the <hi>branches,</hi> and a growth in the <hi>root,</hi> as a tree grows ſometimes upwards in <hi>branches,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times downward in <hi>root:</hi> So thy <hi>grace growes</hi> ſometimes in <hi>branches,</hi> as in love, humility, brokenneſs of heart, &amp;c. ſometimes in <hi>root,</hi> as when thy faith <hi>grows</hi> more, and <hi>roots</hi> it ſelfe in Chriſt, and the promiſe more. Now how is it with thee ſoul? Thou doſt not <hi>grow in branches</hi> as once thou didſt, that is, thou doſt not finde ſuch a lively heart, ſuch ſtrong affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſuch a flowing of heavenly deſires, ſo much brokenneſs of heart, love to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, &amp;c. But doſt thou grow <hi>in the root,</hi> doth thy want of theſe things cauſe thee to <hi>root</hi> thy ſelf more in the free promiſe? ſo as that now thou doſt more and oftner go out to God upon the account of the general promiſe, then it was uſual with thee to do when thou hadſt and foundeſt in thee theſe things; then ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it thou <hi>doſt grow,</hi> and though thy <hi>growth</hi> is not ſo much to ſenſe as it would bee, didſt thou <hi>grow</hi> more in the <hi>branches,</hi> yet is it a better, a ſurer <hi>growth.</hi> That tree ſtands faſteſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115823:79"/>that grows much in the <hi>root.</hi>

                  <p>There is abundance more in theſe words than at the firſt bluſh there ſeems to bee in them, the marrow and ſweetneſs of theſe words lyes in the breaking of the bone, or in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the termes, what is meant by <hi>FLESH</hi> and what by <hi>SPIRIT.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FLESH</hi> and <hi>SPIRIT</hi> are very <hi>general termes,</hi> and of a large extent in holy Scripture, taking in betwixt them both, all the <hi>motions, actions, thoughts, inclinations, wiſdome, reaſoning, doing,</hi> of man-kinde; all being either <hi>fleſh</hi> or <hi>ſpirit,</hi> there is not a thought, nor an inclination nor a reaſoning, nor an action, good or bad, but it is one of theſe two, either <hi>Fleſh</hi> or <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which large extent, <hi>FLESH</hi> comprehends <hi>whatſoever is contrary unto, or is not of the Spirit of God:</hi> Whatſoever thought, reaſoning, or action, whether it be a good moral action, or an evill ſinful action, that is contrary unto, that is not of, ſprings not from the Spirit of God, that is <hi>Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>SPIRIT</hi> comprehends <hi>whatſoever is contrary unto, and is not of the Fleſh:</hi> Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever imaginations, inclinations wiſdome, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, righteouſneſs, that is contrary unto, that is not of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that is <hi>Spirit:</hi> Or as a Godly man (Mr. <hi>Cradocke</hi> upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4.) (as it ſeems to mee doth better expreſs it (though in ſubſtance the ſame with what is ſpoken) thus: <hi>Fleſh</hi> (ſaith hee) that takes in whatſoever is of old <hi>Adam; Spirit</hi> whatſoever is of new <hi>Adam.</hi> Theſe two <hi>Adams</hi> being as hee ſaith, the two roots, beginnings, beings, or principles from

                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>Spirit</hi> is meant, <hi>whatſoever comes and ſprings from the new Adam Jeſus Chriſt, or the Spirit of Chriſt within;</hi> what ever motion, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, thought, inclination, wiſdome, reaſoning, righteouſneſs, doing, comes from Chriſt, grows upon the root of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> that is <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Onely here I would exclude from <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> in the <hi>general ſenſe</hi> it hath been laid down, all thoſe motions, and actions, which are purely natural, having neither any thing of Religion nor ſin in them, but are in their own proper nature neither good, nor evill; as for

                  </p>
                  <p>The upſhot, or <hi>concluſion</hi> of the matter in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> is this, To walk after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> is when a mans <hi>thoughts, motions, reaſonings,</hi> his <hi>wiſdome, righteouſneſs,</hi> his <hi>wayes, proceedings, practiſes,</hi> run all, in the very path and footſteps of <hi>old Adam,</hi> either <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, or faln <hi>Adam:</hi> And to walk after the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is when <hi>all theſe</hi> go in the path-way or ſteps of the <hi>new Adam, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much in the <hi>general;</hi> now for a <hi>more particular</hi> inquiry into the meaning of theſe words of <hi>FLESH</hi> and <hi>SPIRIT.</hi> I do conceive they have ſome reference unto what the Apoſtle had diſcourſed of, in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Two things hee had been ſpeaking of, firſt, Of the <hi>Law, and Goſpel,</hi> ſhewing a beleevers liberation or freedome from the one, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtation by vertue of Chriſts death, and his marriage to Chriſt under the other. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Of the <hi>old and new man,</hi> ſhewing that great and continual conflict that is betwixt theſe two in every beleever, and the happy victory which beleevers in the end through
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115823:84"/>the ſtrength of Chriſt get over the <hi>old man;</hi> the diſcourſe of which hee continues to the very end of the Chapter. Now as touching <hi>either of theſe,</hi> it is uſual in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-language to give the name of <hi>Fleſh</hi> to the one, and <hi>Spirit</hi> to the other.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Law</hi> is called <hi>Fleſh,</hi> Rom. 4.1. compared with 2. <hi>What ſhall wee ſay then, that Abraham our Father, as pertaining to the Fleſh hath found? for if Abraham were juſtified by works, hee hath whereof to glory, but not before God,</hi> Phil. 3.4. <hi>Though I might alſo have confidence in the fleſh, if any other man thinketh that hee hath whereof he might truſt in the fleſh, I more.</hi> Comp. with the 6. v. <hi>concerning zeal, perſecuting the Church; touching the righteouſneſſe which is in the Law, blameleſſe.</hi> The <hi>Goſpel</hi> is called a <hi>Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6. <hi>Who alſo hath made us able Miniſters of the New Teſtament, not of the letter, but of the Spirit:</hi> Both are together under theſe names or titles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>This onely would I learn of you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived yee the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith? Are yee ſo fooliſh? having begun in the Spirit, are yee now made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by the fleſh?</hi> What hee calls works of the <hi>Law,</hi> and hearing of <hi>faith,</hi> in verſ. 2. hee calls <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in the third.</p>
                  <p>Again, the <hi>old man</hi> is called <hi>Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.19. <hi>Now the works of the Fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe, adultery, fornication, uncleanneſs, laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; &amp;c.</hi> compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might bee deſtroyed, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth wee ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:115823:84"/>
                  <p>The <hi>new man</hi> is called <hi>Spirit,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, &amp;c.</hi> both together are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe names, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. laſt. <hi>So then, with the minde I my ſelfe ſerve the Law of God, but with the Fleſh the Law of ſin,</hi> Gal. 5.17. <hi>For the Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Fleſh,</hi> Matth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now that there is <hi>good reaſon</hi> why wee ſhould take <hi>both theſe,</hi> and not <hi>one</hi> to hee <hi>here meant,</hi> I think the <hi>ſcope</hi> ſhews us, for the Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoken of <hi>both theſe</hi> things in the former Chapter, and proceeding onwards to a glorious triumph in this, hee takes the <hi>riſe</hi> of this <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph</hi> from the conſideration of the <hi>premiſes,</hi> and that of both of them; for one alone (as may by good reaſon be made to appear) had not been a ſufficient bottome for ſuch a <hi>triumph;</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, Theſe things being ſo, that through Jeſus Chriſt (as hath been cleared) wee are delivered from the dominion of the <hi>Law,</hi> and alſo from the tyranny of the <hi>old man</hi> in us, there being now no longer any <hi>reigning</hi> Law over us, nor reigning <hi>old man</hi> in us, I therefore do conclude, <hi>That there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> there being no enemy that can do it, the <hi>Law</hi> without, and the <hi>old man</hi> within, which onely were able to do it, having now no <hi>condemning</hi> power over them; which perſons, that hee might give an infallible note and <hi>character</hi> of, hee (ſtill keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcope) deſcribes them to bee ſuch, <hi>Who walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit,</hi> i.e.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115823:85"/>They are ſuch perſons, who being by Chriſt ſet <hi>free</hi> from the <hi>Dominion</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> of the <hi>old man,</hi> do not walk after the one, or the other; and on the other ſide, being by Chriſt brought under the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>new man,</hi> they do now walk as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes (in ſome meaſure) Goſpel Saints, and new creatures.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being laid down, and premiſed, wee are to underſtand the words thus, <hi>Walking after the Fleſh,</hi> i.e.</p>
                  <p>Either firſt, <hi>Legal walking,</hi> to walk after, or according to the Law.</p>
                  <p>Or ſecondly, <hi>Corrupt walking,</hi> i. e. to bee wholly and conſtantly ſwayed, ruled, or lead by the principles, dictates, or motions of the <hi>old man,</hi> or unregenerate part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walking after the Spirit,</hi> i.e.</p>
                  <p>Either firſt, <hi>Goſpel-walking,</hi> to walk after, or according to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Or ſecondly, <hi>Renewed walking,</hi> to walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule, principle, motions, and dictates of the <hi>new man,</hi> or regenerate part in a Saint.</p>
                  <p>Now in ſaying that theſe two are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> I do not exclude any of thoſe laid down in the <hi>general explication</hi> of the words; no, I do think that by <hi>Fleſh</hi> the Apoſtle may mean <hi>all thoſe,</hi> viz. mans wiſdome, reaſon, underſtanding, outward priviledges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

(before quoted) when the <hi>Galathians</hi> were gone from the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> from the <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> to the <hi>old Covenant</hi> of works, to look for life and juſtification: The Apoſtle then calls the <hi>Law Fleſh.</hi> So in Chap. 4 21, 22, 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaking exprefly of the <hi>two Covenants,</hi> the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Old,</hi> or of Grace and Works, whereof one, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>old Covenant</hi> was <hi>Hagar</hi> the bond-woman, the other <hi>Sarah,</hi> the free-woman, he in plain lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage calls <hi>Hagar</hi> the bond-woman, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>old Covenant, Fleſh.</hi> verſ. 23. and 29. So alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. wee have a place pertinent to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>When wee were in the Fleſh, i.e.</hi> when wee were in, or under the <hi>old Covenant,</hi> and did <hi>walk</hi> by the <hi>Law,</hi> as it was a rule of the <hi>old Covenant,</hi> there were by the ſame continually occaſioned
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115823:86"/>riſings and ſtirrings of ſin within us; here the Apoſtle in plaine termes calls the <hi>old Covenant Fleſh,</hi> as before.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Apoſtle doth here ſpeak of the <hi>old Covenant,</hi> is clear from the next verſe, <hi>But now we are delivered from the Law, that being dead, wherein we were held;</hi> as if hee had ſaid, now we who are beleevers, are delivered from the <hi>Law</hi> as it is a <hi>Covenant of works;</hi> Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Covenant of works</hi> it ſelf by which wee were held once, and bound to the performance of the <hi>Law,</hi> is dead; What was it that wee were held by? why the <hi>Law,</hi> as a <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> as Gal. 3.23. <hi>But before faith came, wee were kept under the Law, ſhut up unto faith, which ſhould afterwards be revealed.</hi> Now that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we were held is dead, therefore the <hi>old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> is — that's the meaning, ſo that here hee ſpeaks of the <hi>old Covenant</hi> — So alſo in the next words, <hi>that we might ſerve in newneſs of ſpirit, and not in the oldneſs of the letter,</hi> i. e. that all our obedience which now we perform to God might be inward and ſpiritual, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the way of the <hi>new Covenant</hi> we are under, <hi>i. e.</hi> ariſing from new Principles put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, new thoughts, and new apprehenſions of God begot within us, new ſtrength and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance given us, new ends in our working, and not in that way of outward and litteral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, which was the way of the <hi>old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> here he ſpeaks plainly of the <hi>old Covenant,</hi> ſhewing the difference betwixt that obedience which that produceth, and that which the <hi>new Covenant</hi> brings forth; therefore what he calls
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115823:87"/>
                     <hi>Fleſh</hi> in the former verſe, by weighing the ſcope, can be no other but the <hi>old Covenant</hi> which he ſpeaks of in this.</p>
                  <p>I could bring many other places, but theſe may ſuffice to ſhew us, that when the <hi>Law</hi> is called <hi>Fleſh,</hi> we are to underſtand the <hi>Law</hi> as it is the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;</hi> which being ſo, by <hi>legal walking</hi> in this place which the Apoſtle calls <hi>Fleſh,</hi> wee are to underſtand <hi>walking,</hi> according to the way of the <hi>old Covenant, walking</hi> after the <hi>Law,</hi> as the ſame is a <hi>Covenant of works.</hi>

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Is it ſo that <hi>Legal walking</hi> is <hi>walking after the Fleſh?</hi> Then this diſcovers to us, that <hi>there are abundance of rotten-hearted Profeſſors in the world.</hi> How many perſons are there who <hi>walk</hi> after the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> I mean who are <hi>pure Legal walkers.</hi> Should wee come to thoſe who are <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> the general bulk of <hi>Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi> who <hi>walke</hi> in a way of duty, and ſearch them narrowly, wee ſhould finde ten to one to be <hi>Legal walkers:</hi> All their Religion, their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115823:95"/>duties, their prayers, tears, repentance, &amp;c. it ſprings from the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> is principle, and motive in their obedience, the great and onely wheel and engine that turns all, and carries them to all that they do. Such a man prayes in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, is a frequenter of Sermons, &amp;c. But why? Alas, hee dares not do otherwiſe, the <hi>Law</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules him, the <hi>Law</hi> hath got command in his conſcience, ſo that ſhould hee not pray, &amp;c. and do ſome good, and avoid ſome evil, hee ſhould have no peace, nor quiet within, his conſcience would bee his tormentor, and continually laſh him; and therefore hee doth theſe things, not out of any love to the thing hee doth; no, hee hates them, counts them his burden, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable task, and would gladly, could hee finde a way to avoid hell, and get heaven, without doing of any of theſe things throw off all; but becauſe hee knows no other way, hee therefore goes on, though fore againſt his will, moving heavily, as the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Chariots when they had loſt their wheels, in a track of duty. And therefore you ſhall obſerve that <hi>ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> when they come to hear of the <hi>free grace</hi> of God, and the <hi>Goſpel-way</hi> to ſalvation by Chriſt without the <hi>works of the Law;</hi> if a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter come and tell them, that would they go to heaven and bee ſaved, the way is not to <hi>worke,</hi> and <hi>worke,</hi> and <hi>worke,</hi> but to <hi>beleeve</hi> on Chriſt who hath purchaſed ſalvation for poor ſinners, and gives it out freely without any merit or deſert of theirs, they make this uſe of it to throw off all: If God will ſave them, which is all they have a care for, they will
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115823:95"/>do nothing now for God, or the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>As it is with <hi>young trees,</hi> in the <hi>tranſplanting</hi> of them, uſually moſt of them wither, and come to nothing. So take a company of <hi>Legal walkers,</hi> and go about to <hi>tranſplant</hi> them, bring them from the <hi>Law</hi> to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and there are but few of them that will not miſcarry and come to nothing in the removing: When the <hi>Law</hi> is gone, and the fear of Hell is off their hearts, they will do nothing for the love of God, or the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>I have read of a man that was ſo exact in duty, that hee would never go forth in the morning, but hee would firſt go to prayer by himſelf, and when hee had prayed hee would ſay to himſelf, Now Devil do thy worſt, and all the day long would haunt the Ale-houſes, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, and Whore-houſes, and come home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at night and go to pray. Take the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Profeſſors</hi> throughout the world, and their Religion is ſuch a kinde of Religion as this mans was, though I will not ſay they are ſo prophane as hee (every <hi>legal</hi> conſcience is not ſo large) yet uſually they go on in a track of duties: They will ſerve God morning and evening, and if this bee done, though the world and Devil have their hearts all the day beſides, yet they thinke all is well, and that by their morning and evening prayers, they make God amends for all their ſin, their pride, their worldlineſſe, wantonneſſe, uncleanneſſe, all the day beſides.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome Papiſts (they ſay) that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115823:96"/>carry a Crucifix about with them, and when they have been drunk, or unclean, or blaſphemed God, &amp;c. Their manner is to take their Crucifix and kiſs that, and howle over it a while, and when they have ſo done, they will return to their ſin again. So there are many <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> who though they have not their Crucifixes, yet ſomewhat they have which ſerves them inſtead thereof, which ordinarily is ſome outward duty, and when they have committed any ſin, they run to their duty, and there lick themſelves whole, and having ſo done, back from their duty, to their ſin again. You therefore that are <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> look to your ſelves, I ſay, look to your ſelves, for (as a godly man ſaith) there are many hundred <hi>Profeſſors</hi> which bear forth a broad <hi>profeſſion,</hi> and make a glorious ſhew in the eyes of the world, who will bee found to bee ſons of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> at the laſt day; bare <hi>Legal Profeſſors:</hi> And with this kinde of <hi>Profeſſion</hi> a man may, and many there are which do, go bravely through the world with top, and top gallant up, carrying the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of Town and Country where they dwell, for men of excelling godlineſs, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and yet bee ſtrangers to Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>true Goſpel-holineſs</hi> for all this.</p>
                  <p>In good earneſt therefore, look to your ſelves, <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> and conſider ſeriouſly the ground you ſtand upon, whether it bee <hi>Legal,</hi> or <hi>Goſpel-ground,</hi> leſt after you have travelled many miles as you come heaven-ward, you are found to be nearer hell, then when you firſt ſet out.</p>

                  <p>The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Thoſe that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> So let mee ſay, There is never an <hi>action</hi> which is <hi>an action</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> (as every <hi>pure Legal action</hi> is) that either is or can be <hi>pleaſing</hi> to God.

                  <p>So there is many a man and woman that ſayes over a <hi>prayer</hi> ſometimes, and thinks God indebted to him, when alas poor ſoul, when the reckoning day comes wherein hee expects his reward for his <hi>worke,</hi> hee ſhall finde to his woe, that God will not <hi>owne</hi> any of theſe his <hi>prayers,</hi> but God will ſay to him as to thoſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical faſters the Prophet ſpeaks of, <hi>When yee faſted, faſted yee at all to mee, even to mee, ſaith the Lord?</hi> So will God ſay, Man, woman, thou haſt <hi>prayed,</hi> but didſt thou <hi>pray to mee,</hi> at all
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115823:97"/>to mee? were not all thy <hi>prayers</hi> becauſe thou waſt afraid of hell, or becauſe thy conſcience whipped thee to it, or thou hadſt a deſign hereby to get credit amongſt thy friends, and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? &amp;c. Is this <hi>praying</hi> to mee? Or, will God ſay to them, as Chriſt ſaid to thoſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. who come to him with Lord, Lord in their mouthes, wee have propheſied in thy Name, wee have done thus and thus for thee; but what ſaith Chriſt? <hi>Depart from mee, I know you not, yee workers of iniquity.</hi> So it may bee thou wilt come one day with thy crowd of <hi>Legal works</hi> to Chriſt, Lord, behold at ſuch a time I prayed, at ſuch a time did ſuch a duty, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time reſiſted ſuch a ſin; Away will Chriſt ſay, <hi>I know you not,</hi> I know none of your <hi>works,</hi> neither will I <hi>own</hi> them, yee did nothing for mee, your works are <hi>works of iniquity,</hi> and you are <hi>workers of iniquity,</hi> and therefore away, bee gone, here is no room for you, nor your works, <hi>Depart from mee yee workers of iniquity.</hi>

                  <p>How came it about that the poor Publican, who could ſpeak but <hi>one word</hi> was accepted, whereas the proud Phariſee which made a <hi>long Oration</hi> of his own doing; worth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency was ſent going as hee came, but onely hence: The poor Publican, though hee could ſpeak but <hi>one word,</hi> yet it was a <hi>Goſpel-word,</hi> and ſo there was <hi>Spirit</hi> in it; the proud Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee though hee ſpake <hi>many words,</hi> yet all were <hi>Legal</hi> and ſo but <hi>Fleſh.</hi> Now there may bee many a poor ſoul in the world, who like the poor Publican, when hee comes to a duty can hardly ſpeak ten words to God, yet becauſe

                  <p>I have ſpoken to the firſt. Now I come to the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> Goſpel walking is <hi>walking
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115823:99"/>after the Spirit.</hi> Here our firſt Queſtion will bee.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>What Goſpel walking is?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſw. <hi>Goſpel walking is to yeeld obedience to the Commands of God, as they are handed to us by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> or, To make the <hi>Law of God,</hi> as it is the <hi>Law of Chriſt,</hi> the rule of our lives and actions.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Law</hi> I underſtand the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> taking in the <hi>ſpiritual expoſition</hi> thereof by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles in the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> for thoſe <hi>precepts to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> that wee read of throughout the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> are but the <hi>ſpiritual expoſition</hi> of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law,</hi> as is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. where Chriſt himſelf in expounding the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> layes down many <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Evangelical duties;</hi> yea all the <hi>commands</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> may bee ſummed up under theſe two heads, Either <hi>loving God,</hi> or our <hi>neighbour as our ſelves,</hi> both which in the <hi>ſpirituality</hi> of the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, are required in the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> as Chriſt teacheth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37, to the 41. The <hi>Moral Law</hi> is as it were the <hi>Text</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, the <hi>explication</hi> and opening of it: The <hi>Moral Law</hi> is the baſis, or foundation of all duties of holineſs, the teaching of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, the <hi>ſtructure,</hi> or rather the <hi>compleating,</hi> and filling up of the building. So that by <hi>Law,</hi> I do not underſtand <hi>another Law</hi> diſtinct in matter or ſubſtance from the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> but the <hi>Moral Law</hi> it ſelfe for the matter and ſubſtance thereof. Now the <hi>Moral Law</hi> comes under a <hi>double conſideration,</hi> either as it is the <hi>matter</hi> or ſubſtance of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Law,</hi> what
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115823:99"/>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded, and ſo the ſubſtance of the <hi>old Covenant,</hi> or elſe, as it is the <hi>matter</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Chriſts Law,</hi> what Chriſt in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>new Covenant</hi> requires of Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                  <p>Hence in reference to the <hi>firſt part</hi> of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, it is frequently in Scripture, called the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> beleevers are ſaid not to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>For ſin ſhall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the Law, but under grace,</hi> Gal. 5.18. <hi>But if yee bee lead of the Spirit, yee are not under the Law;</hi> yea, to bee dead to it, and delivered from it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4.16. <hi>Wherefore my brethren, yee are alſo become dead to the Law by the body of Chriſt, &amp;c. but now wee are delivered from the Law, &amp;c.</hi> its ſaid to gender to bondage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Which things are an Allegory, for theſe are the two Covenants, the one from the Mount Sinai which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In reference to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> its called <hi>the Law of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6.2. <hi>Bear yee one anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and ſo fulfill the Law of Chriſt.</hi> Bearing one anothers burden is a ſpiritual duty which comes under the ſecond Table of the <hi>Law</hi> of loving our neighbours as our ſelves, and this is called a part of <hi>Chriſts Law.</hi> Beleevers are ſaid to bee under it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.21. <hi>To them that are without Law, as without Law (being not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law to God, but under the Law to Chriſt) &amp;c.</hi> It is called a <hi>Law</hi> of liberty, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.12. <hi>So ſpeake yee, and ſo do, as they that ſhall bee judged by the Law of liberty.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſpeaks plainly there of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> as from the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115823:100"/>verſes above appears. It is called the <hi>Royal Law,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the <hi>Kingly Law,</hi> or the <hi>Law of Chriſt,</hi> as King of Saints. This diſtinction Chriſt teacheth us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. where repeating and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> he ſaith, it was ſaid of old thus and thus, <hi>i. e.</hi> thus <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, thus the <hi>Law</hi> as it was <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law ſaid, but ſaith he, I ſay unto you, <hi>i. e.</hi> thus the <hi>Law</hi> as it is my <hi>Law</hi> ſaith unto you. This <hi>Paul</hi> well knew, and therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. handles the <hi>Law</hi> under this two fold conſideration; as <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, he ſaith we are dead to it, <hi>delivered</hi> from it, and have nothing to doe therewith; as <hi>Chriſts,</hi> he ſaith, he did <hi>approve</hi> of it, <hi>delight</hi> in it, and endeavour to <hi>conforme</hi> thereto. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. <hi>For the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, hath made me free from the law of ſin and death;</hi> he makes a clear diſtinction betwixt the <hi>Law</hi> as it was in <hi>Moſes</hi> his hand, adminiſtring ſin and death to thoſe under it, and in <hi>Chriſts,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpirit and life; and he ſaith, that beleevers by being under the <hi>Law</hi> as <hi>Chriſts,</hi> are freed fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m, as <hi>Moſes</hi>'s. And in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19. <hi>For I through the Law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</hi> He tells us that by vertue of being under the <hi>Law</hi> as it is in the <hi>hand of Chriſt;</hi> he tells us, he was dead to it, as in the hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe things laid down, I ſay, <hi>Goſpel walking is to make the Law of God</hi> (i. e. <hi>the Moral Law</hi>) <hi>as it is the Law of Chriſt, the rule of our lives and actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the making out of this, three things are to be proved.</p>

                  <list>
                     <item>1 That the Moral Law in Goſpel-times, is a <hi>Rule to Beleevers,</hi> elſe making it our Rule can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Goſpel-walking.</item>
                     <item>2 That it is a Rule only as in the <hi>hand of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3 That to obey and obſerve the Law as it is in the hand of Chriſt, is <hi>truly and properly Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-walking.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The firſt I make good by theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Argument 1. <hi>If the coming of Chriſt doth not deſtroy the Law as a Rule, but fulfill, or compleat the ſame, then is the Law in Goſpel-times a rule to beleevers.</hi> But the firſt is true, Matth. 5.17. <hi>Think not that I am come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Law or the Prophets, I am not come to deſtroy, but to fulfill.</hi> What <hi>fulfilling</hi> is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling here ſpoken of? Not ſo much <hi>Chriſts</hi> fulfilling the <hi>Law</hi> for us as our <hi>common perſon,</hi> though this bee a truth, as the <hi>perfecting</hi> or <hi>compleating</hi> of the <hi>Law; I came to fulfill the Law,</hi> that is, to <hi>compleat</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> to fill up the <hi>Law</hi> which the <hi>Jewes</hi> took by halves, or peece-meals, and this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> doth properly ſignifie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh, perfect or <hi>fill up</hi> a thing, being (as ſome ſay) a Metaphor taken from a Ship under ſayl, whoſe ſayls are filled with wind; and this, Chriſt's own ſpeaking to the end of the Chapter clearly ſhews, he going on to declare the <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſenſe</hi> and meaning of the <hi>Law,</hi> beyond what the <hi>Jewes</hi> underſtood thereof, or <hi>Moſes</hi> had diſcovered to them. Therefore the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>Argum. 2. <hi>If the Moral Law bee a perpetual
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115823:101"/>and everlaſting Rule to Saints in all Ages, then to Saints in Goſpel-times.</hi> But the firſt is true, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. for <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, till heaven and earth paſſe, one jot, or one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſſe from the Law till all be fulfilled.</hi> As long as Heaven and Earth remaines, ſo long doth the <hi>Law</hi> remaine, and the <hi>fulfilling</hi> thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the precedent verſe, to <hi>perfect</hi> or fill a thing up, but to <hi>doe</hi> or performe a thing. Now there is a two-fold <hi>fulfilling</hi> or performing of the <hi>Law,</hi> a <hi>fulfilling</hi> or performing thereof in <hi>Chriſt</hi> as our Head and <hi>common Perſon,</hi> this was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly accompliſhed by and in Chriſt when hee was here; and there is a fulfilling or perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Law</hi> in us the <hi>Members,</hi> this becauſe it is imperfect, and wrought by degrees, goes perpetually on increaſing till wee come to bee wholly like our Head; and this I take it, is that which is here ſpoken of, which ſhall remaine as long as Heaven and Earth remaine, <hi>i. e.</hi> as long as Heaven and Earth ſtands, Saints ſhall goe daily on fulfilling of the <hi>Law,</hi> till in the end their obedience comes to bee perfect as Chriſts was.</p>
                  <p>Argum. 3. <hi>If the preaching of Faith doth not make voyd the Law, but eſtabliſh the ſame, then doth the Law ſtill remaine as a Rule to Beleevers in Goſpel-times.</hi> But the firſt is true, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Nay we eſtabliſh the Law,</hi> i. e. by the preaching of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> wee doe not over-turn the <hi>Law,</hi> make men Libertines, and free them from the

                  <p>Argum. 4. <hi>If the ſubſtance of thoſe things which are required in the Moral Law are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Goſpel, promiſed to Goſpel-times, then doth the Law remaine a Rule to Beleevers ſtill.</hi> But the firſt is true; as for example, Doth the <hi>Law</hi> in general <hi>require</hi> of us to love God with all our heart, with all our ſoul, with all our might, and with all our ſtrength, and to love our neighbour as our ſelves? and doth not the <hi>Goſpel</hi> every where <hi>command</hi> theſe things? Doth the <hi>Law require</hi> of us to love, ſerve, and obey one God, and the true God; and doth not the <hi>Goſpel</hi> doe this? Doth the <hi>Law require</hi> us to worſhip God in his owne way, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding all Idol worſhip; and doth not the <hi>Gospel</hi> doe this? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20, 21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16, 17. doth the <hi>Law require</hi> us to ſanctify Gods Name; and doth not the <hi>Gospel too, Jam.</hi> 5.12?

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115823:102"/>in the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> to teach us the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Sabbath is <hi>Evangelical,</hi> the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law</hi> being but the <hi>Goſpel</hi> under Types and Figures. Doth the <hi>Law</hi> require obedience to Superiours, and doth not the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> yea, is not the Fifth command in expreſſe words com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.2?

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the great Queſtion, without opening wherof, all we have hitherto ſaid comes to nothing: For anſwer therefore hereunto, we ſhall conſider, how the <hi>Law came in the hand of Moſes,</hi> when it came as the <hi>Rule of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works;</hi> which opened, will help us in the conſideration of the other, how it comes in <hi>Chriſts hand,</hi> as it is our <hi>Goſpel rule.</hi>

                  <p>If you would know how the <hi>Law came in Moſes.</hi> his <hi>hand,</hi> if we look into Scripture, it tells us three things concerning it.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 It came with <hi>bare commands:</hi> It had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Do this and live; and theſe commands were <hi>bare commands,</hi> commands without any life or power, and therefore it is called a <hi>voyce of words.</hi> Heb. 12.</item>
                     <item>2 It came <hi>with fearful threatnings and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible denunciations of wrath to the diſobedient, to</hi> ſcare men from ſin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every

                  </list>
                  <p>Thus the Law came, as it came in the <hi>hand of Moſes,</hi> and was the <hi>Rule</hi> of a <hi>Covenant of works;</hi> but now as it comes in the <hi>hands of Chriſt,</hi> and is our <hi>Goſpel Rule</hi> (I mean the Rule of Saints under the Goſpel, for to other men the Law ſtill remains in force as it was given by <hi>Moſes</hi>) to it comes without either of theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It doth not come with <hi>bare commands as Moſes</hi> his <hi>Law did,</hi> it hath commands, and more ſpiritual than the Law had in the <hi>hands of Moſes,</hi> but theſe are not <hi>bare commands,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands without any life or power, no, but there is a <hi>power and efficacy</hi> that goes forth with every command of the Law as it is in the <hi>hands of Chriſt,</hi> there is an <hi>exceeding aptneſs of power,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling the ſoul to do what it commands; ſo that a poor ſoul receiving the <hi>Law</hi> from the <hi>hands of Chriſt,</hi> is not left lame and dead, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to follow the voyce of the <hi>Law,</hi> but it findes <hi>life and power</hi> coming in with the command: It bids the ſoul pray, and gives the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to inable to cry <hi>Abba Father;</hi> it bids it avoid evill, and do good, and <hi>inables</hi> it to do the one, and the other: Thus the ſoul is not left liveleſs, and ſtrengthleſs, it doth not go about, wiſhing and woulding; O that I could obey, O that I could keep the Law, O that I could leave ſin,

                  <p n="3">3 It doth not come with <hi>alluring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of life and ſalvation</hi> to the obedient: The <hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>hand of Christ</hi> it doth not come with a voyce, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> It doth not ſay, Soul, if thou wilt obey mee thou ſhalt <hi>have heaven;</hi> But ſaith the <hi>Law,</hi> thou poor ſinner who haſt cloſed with Chriſt, know for certain, <hi>Heaven is thine</hi> already, <hi>ſalvation</hi> is ſure to thee, thou hadſt the grant of this, and it was <hi>made ſure</hi> to thee by an unchangeable deed of gift from thy Father upon thy belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving day, and therefore ſhould I <hi>promiſe</hi> thee this, in caſe thou wouldeſt hearken to my voice, I ſhould <hi>promiſe</hi> thee nothing at all, becauſe I ſhould <hi>promiſe</hi> thee no more than what thou haſt already, and none can ever deprive thee of, for all this is thine; yea, as I cannot <hi>promiſe</hi> thee this in caſe thou ſhouldeſt obey mee, ſo needeſt thou not fear <hi>loſing</hi> of this, if through thine own weakneſs, or the prevalency of thy corruption, thou ſhouldeſt fall, and diſobey mee: But this is that I am thee Meſſenger of, there is another (<hi>viz.</hi> the Goſpel) which hath been before mee, and aſſured thee heaven is thine, but that I am the Meſſenger of, is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tell thee, how it <hi>becomes thee,</hi> being a

The firſt reſpects our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> the latter our <hi>Sanctification,</hi> or our obedience and walking. Now as <hi>Chriſt crucified</hi> is the <hi>great Principle</hi> in the buſineſs of our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> whence alone that flows from the knowing and beleeving on a <hi>Crucified Chriſt;</hi> ſo the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt in the hearts of Saints, is the <hi>great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> in the matter of our <hi>obedience,</hi> whence that flows. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. the Sons of God are ſaid to bee <hi>lead</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, <hi>i.e.</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth not onely <hi>teach</hi> a beleever what is his duty, but doth as it were take him by the hand and <hi>lead</hi> him to it, help and guide him in it. There is more held forth in the word <hi>lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> than in <hi>teaching:</hi> I teach another when I write him a copy and lay it before him, and tell him how hee ſhould hold his pen, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and guide his hand, but now when I do not onely do this, but take his hand in mine, and write therewith, I may bee better ſaid to guide or <hi>lead</hi> him: So the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God <hi>teacheth</hi> a beleever, when it makes diſcovery of any truth to him hee was ignorant of before, and ſhows him what duty that truth calls for from him; but when it doth not onely do this, but alſo <hi>inables</hi> the ſoul to receive this truth, and to walk up to what this truth calls for, conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115823:109"/>the ſoul to the truth or will of God, then doth it exerciſe its <hi>leading power</hi> in the ſoule: And therefore <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. God ſaith, <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walke in my wayes, &amp;c.</hi> In the <hi>Goſpel</hi> or <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God put into a beleever, is the <hi>cauſing,</hi> conſtraining <hi>principle</hi> to obedience and <hi>holy walking.</hi> As in the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> though the fruit ſeem never ſo glorious, yet the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> or root of all obedience is <hi>Fleſh.</hi> So in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> though the outward fruit ſeem never ſo mean and weak, yet the <hi>principle</hi> or root is the <hi>Spirit.</hi> All <hi>Goſpel</hi> graces and works are fruits of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith? meekneſs, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> All that <hi>obedience</hi> therefore which hath not the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God for the <hi>principle,</hi> the root, or riſe thereof, though ever ſo glorious, is not <hi>Goſpel-obedience,</hi> nor <hi>Goſpel-walking.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more hereto at preſent, but onely this, doeſt thou finde a contentedneſs of heart in thy obedience, mingled with pride, ſelf-eſtimation, &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> when thou haſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed any duty, doſt thou finde thy ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and ſatisfied in having done the ſame, and art thou proud and arrogant, accounting thy ſelf ſome body, becauſe thou haſt done it? Or on the other ſide, doeſt thou find a ſpiritual rejoycing of heart in that thou haſt been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to perform thy duty, and this mingled with humility and mortification; my meaning
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115823:109"/>is, when thou haſt been obedient in any one particular; doeſt thou rejoyce in God, and bleſs his name, in that hee hath inabled thee ſo to do, and conſidering it was not in thine own proper ſtrength to obey God in any thing? Art thou by and under this obedience kept humble, having thy pride and ſelf-eſtimation more mortified in thee than thou didſt finde it before. If the firſt, <hi>then doth not thy obedience ariſe front the Spirit,</hi> becauſe it takes from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which no works of the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth; if the latter, <hi>then aſſuredly the Spirit of God is the principle, the root of thy obedience,</hi> becauſe it gives to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, as every worke which is by, and from the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> doth.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such as theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>The will and command of our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> You know the difference betwixt a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and a ſon in working; a ſervant will not do any work for his Maſter, unleſſe there bee a <hi>compact and agreement</hi> betwixt his Maſter and him, his Maſter muſt give him ſo much wages? and hee will do him ſo much work: But now when a Son is to do any work for his <hi>Father,</hi> hee doth not <hi>capitulate,</hi> with his <hi>Father,</hi> if you will give mee ſo much I will do your work, but if not, I will not; no, but the <hi>Father</hi> ſaith to the Son, Son do mee ſuch a peece of work, and preſently the Son hearing the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> goes about it, the <hi>Fathers</hi> will is his <hi>Motive.</hi> So take a legal man or
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115823:110"/>woman, and let God <hi>command</hi> ſuch a one a duty, and ſtreightway hee goes to <hi>capitulate</hi> with God, I hope Lord, if I do this, thou wilt pardon my ſins, I hope thou wilt give mee heaven, I ſhall never go to hell; thus the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſoul</hi> will bee upon <hi>termes</hi> with God, or will do nothing for God, hee will know what hee ſhall have for his work, or will not work at all: But now take a <hi>Goſpel ſoul,</hi> hee doth not ſtand upon <hi>termes,</hi> what ſhall I have? Shall I bee ſaved, or ſhall I bee damned? Theſe are not his queſtions; but ſaith the <hi>Goſpel ſoul,</hi> God I know is my <hi>Father</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, and I am the Son and Childe of God by adoption, now it is becoming a Son to do the <hi>will</hi> of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I am the Son of God, and ſuch and ſuch things I have read and heard of, and know to bee my <hi>Fathers will,</hi> and becauſe they are ſo, that I may do as becomes an obedient childe, and ſhew my ſelf that I am ſuch a one, I will therefore endeavour to conform my ſelf, ſo far as I am able, to what I know of my <hi>Fathers will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore whereas it is <hi>grievous</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to read or hear of his duty, becauſe hee ſerves as a hireling, and therefore cares not ſo hee may obtain the hire, how little work hee doth; this <hi>Goſpel ſoul</hi> with <hi>joy &amp; delight,</hi> can take the Book of God, where his <hi>Fathers will</hi> is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and turn it over, and ſearch it leaf by leaf, and line by line, and is glad when he findes any peece of work, or part, or parcel of his <hi>Fathers will,</hi> which he was ignorant of before, becauſe hee doth not what hee doth upon the account of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115823:110"/>
                     <hi>hire or reward,</hi> but upon this account, that it is his <hi>Fathers will;</hi> The <hi>will and command</hi> of his <hi>Father</hi> is both the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth Holineſs in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and thankfulneſs in particular, 1 <hi>The.</hi> 4.3. <hi>For this is the will of God, even your ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that yee ſhould abſtaine from fornication;</hi> and Chap. 5.18. <hi>In every thing give thanks, for this is the will of God in Chriſt Jeſus concerning you.</hi> Upon this very reaſon or motive and no other; as if he ſhould ſay, you are Sons, and therefore I need not uſe many Arguments with you, it is enough to tell you it is the <hi>will</hi> of your <hi>Father</hi> you ſhould be <hi>holy,</hi> you ſhould bee <hi>thankful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>The powerful and efficacious workings of the new nature that is within every Saint or Son of God.</hi> The promiſe of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> is, that God will give to his Children a <hi>new heart and spirit,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. <hi>i.e.</hi> put a <hi>new nature</hi> within them, whereby they ſhall be <hi>naturally</hi> inclined and diſpoſed to the doing of that which is his <hi>Will,</hi> which in other places is called the <hi>Writing of his Law</hi> in their hearts. This <hi>new Nature</hi> is put into every Saint, though in the actings thereof, in ſome more, in others leſs, and being in every Saint, every Saint is <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> inclined and diſpoſed to the doing of that which is wel-pleaſing unto God. As the <hi>old nature</hi> doth <hi>naturally</hi> move, incline, and carry on the Soul to the doing of that which is contrary to the <hi>Will</hi> of God; ſo this <hi>new nature</hi> doth naturally incline, incite, and provoke the Soul to thoſe things which are agreeable to the <hi>Will</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:115823:111"/>of God. Hence a <hi>Goſpel-ſoul</hi> is moved to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, becauſe there is a <hi>new nature</hi> within, which anſwers to the <hi>Law</hi> or Word of God without, which requires obedience of him; and all diſobedience is as contrary to this <hi>new nature</hi> within, as to the <hi>Rule</hi> without.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Love and filial affection.</hi> The bond of <hi>love</hi> is <hi>natural</hi> betwixt a Father and a Son, a Father hath a <hi>Natural affection</hi> to his Childe more than to anothers, and a Childe a <hi>natural affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> to his Father more than to another man; and <hi>love</hi> (though there be no other reaſon) will make the party loving, doe much for the party <hi>loved.</hi> Now I ſay, there is a <hi>tye of love</hi> upon a Son which is not upon a Servant, or Hireling; come to a Servant, or Hireling, and ask him, why hee toyls, and moyls, and ſweats from morning till night, all the year long for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; my Naſter (ſaith hee) gives me wages, and therefore I doe it; but come to a Son, who it may be is as hard, or harder at work than the Servant, and ask him, Why doe you toyl and moyl your ſelf thus? why (ſayes the Son) it is my Fathers work I am doing of, and I <hi>love</hi> my Father. So come to a <hi>Goſpel-ſoul</hi> who hath this Son-like diſpoſition wrought within him, and ask him, Why doe you pray ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and read the Word, and ſpend ſo much time in running to Sermons, and are ſo exact in your walking and converſing with men? Why, ſaith a <hi>Goſpel-ſoul,</hi> all this is my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers work, and I <hi>love</hi> my Father. <hi>Love</hi> is the great <hi>Goſpel-motive,</hi> as <hi>Fear</hi> the great <hi>Legal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:115823:111"/>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>The manifeſtation or diſcovery of the love of God to the ſoul.</hi> As the Son-like diſpoſition which is natural, moves a Saint to obedience and holy walking; ſo the manifeſtation, or diſcovery of the great <hi>love of God</hi> without, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him whilſt hee was a miſerable ſinner, and rebel againſt God, is very efficacious in a poor Soul that ſees and beholds the ſame, to bring him to obedience and holineſs of life and converſation; for hereby his <hi>love</hi> is ſet on work, <hi>love</hi> is the begetter of <hi>love,</hi> the <hi>love</hi> of God to us the begetter of our <hi>love</hi> to him, <hi>We love him becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi> A poor ſinner that was yeſterday, the laſt week, or month, in his ſins, hanging over Hell, in the fetters of the Devil, God comes to him, and by the word of his grace layes hold of him, ſnatcheth him out of his ſins, out of the Devils fetters, and ſets him out of the reach of Condemnation; and then ſaith God, now O Sinner, behold and ſee what a miſerable condition the laſt week or month thou waſt in, and what a bleſſed condition through my <hi>love</hi> towards thee thou now art in; the Soul ſeeing this, ſtands amazed, and ſaith the Soul, Lord, ſeeing thy <hi>love</hi> towards mee hath been and is ſo great, behold here I am, now will I be thy Servant for ever; whereas I have all my daies hitherto been at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Devil, and mine owne Luſts, now Lord, behold I am at thy command, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me what thou wilt. This <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, 2 Cor. 5.14. <hi>For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Would you know the reaſon why we which are Beleevers do not live
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115823:112"/>to our ſelves, ſerve the World, our Luſts and Pleaſures, as you ſee others doe? O there is all the reaſon in the world for it, for when wee were Rebels, Traytors, Enemies to God, dead in ſins, God then out of his <hi>infinite love</hi> gave his Son, and Chriſt out of his <hi>infinite love</hi> dyed for us, and the thoughts of this ſo great and <hi>unſpeakable love,</hi> doth ſo conſtraine us, that we cannot but judge it the moſt equal and meet thing in the world, that henceforth we ſhould not live unto our ſelves, but ſolely and alone to him that dyed for us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>The certainty of the bleſſedneſs of a Saints eternal condition;</hi> This is a very prevailing <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> to know and beleeve that our <hi>eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> already taken care for by our Father, and made ſo ſure and out of doubt, that neither Heaven nor Earth, Men or Angels can ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of the <hi>bleſſedneſſe</hi> thereof. When a poor Soul called to a duty, comes to ſee that now the queſtion is not about his <hi>Salvation,</hi> whether God will <hi>ſave</hi> him or not, for that is <hi>determined</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, God having choſen him, and called him to be an Heir thereof, and given him the ſeal or earneſt thereof in his owne heart, but only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his dutifulneſſe, whether he ſhall be a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving dutiful Childe, and pleaſe his Father, or an undutiful, and grieve him; O then ſaith the Soul, doth the queſtion indeed lye here? Is there no queſtion at all about my <hi>Salvation,</hi> but hath God and my Father ſo provided for that, that that is out of doubt? Is this the queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhal be a dutiful Child or no? and O ſhal I not be one? Should I not be a Wretch indeed,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115823:112"/>and worſe than a Beaſt, if for all this <hi>unſpeakable love,</hi> I ſhould returne nothing but unkindneſs to my Father? Hath God taken care that I ſhall not be puniſhed in Hell, and ſhall not I take care that he be not grieved in my heart? Hath he taken care about my <hi>eternal good,</hi> and ſhall not I about his glory? I dare ſay, were wee much in actual contemplation of this, and our thoughts did but roule hereupon, that wee ſtand reconciled to God in Chriſt, Heaven is ours, &amp;c. did we but when ever wee are called to any duty, or tempted to ſin, take a little time before wee cloſe with either, to recollect our ſelves of the <hi>love of God</hi> in this thing, and to get our faith a little upon the wing, and our hearts warmed herewith, we ſhould never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane our ſelves ſo baſely and unworthily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and in the things of God as oft we doe; our hearts would never bee ſo lively to ſin, and dead to duty as they are.</p>
                  <p>I am perſwaded, that put the caſe a poor Soul were much over-maſtered with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of ſome Luſt or Corruption, if when he felt it ſtirre hee could look the ſame in the face, and in faith ſay to it, O my Corruption, though I ſhould now yeeld to thee, yet this is <hi>certaine</hi> I ſhall <hi>never periſh,</hi> for the buſineſs of my <hi>Salvation</hi> is not now to bee cared for, but that is paſt and over, done, and cannot bee <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed;</hi> I ſay, I am perſwaded, that this very ſaying this by faith would give a more deadly blow to ſin, than all the terrours of Conſcience and the Law, the fears of Hell and Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Legal promiſes, Vowes and Covenants, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115823:113"/>will or can doe; and this, were hee able at ſuch time in faith to ſay it, hee ſhould know and feele by experience. So, put the caſe a Beleever were under ſome violent Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, could hee look Satan in the face, and ſay, thou wretched Devil, thou wouldeſt tempt me to this and the other evil, to grieve God, but what a foole art thou, for ſhould I yeeld unto thee, thy end would never be accompliſhed, for thou ſhalt never have me, I ſhall never <hi>periſh;</hi> the ſaying this in faith, would more ſilence the tempter, and ſuppreſſe temptations, than can be done in any other way.</p>
                  <p>This therefore is a <hi>ſtrong motive</hi> to Goſpel-Holineſs, and ſuch a one, that I dare boldly ſay, that the Soul that hath found his love and obedience at any time flowing from hence, <hi>i. e.</hi> hath had a firme perſwaſion in his Spirit, that Heaven was his, and from this perſwaſion hath been ſtirred up to doe the will of God, and hath gone about the ſame with more cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and delight than at another time, may conclude that his <hi>obedience</hi> is a <hi>fruit</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>walking after the Goſpel;</hi> for how can it be <hi>legal,</hi> ſeeing,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Here is no working from <hi>ſlaviſh fear;</hi> for what ſervile <hi>feare</hi> can there bee when I know before-hand that my <hi>condition is ſure,</hi> it doth not hang upon my working, when I know before-hand that I am <hi>delivered from wrath;</hi> and becauſe I am <hi>delivered from wrath,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doe <hi>obey;</hi> yet put the caſe I ſhould not obey (though being delivered from wrath I ſhall obey) yet cannot my <hi>diſobedience</hi> bring
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115823:113"/>me <hi>under wrath,</hi> for I am delivered from it; What <hi>ſlaviſh fear</hi> is here?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Here is no <hi>working for Heaven,</hi> or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; for how can a Soul be ſaid to <hi>work for Heaven,</hi> when he knowes and firmly beleeves that <hi>Heaven is his</hi> before he works — If a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make over his Eſtate to his Son by Deed of gift, and put him in poſſeſſion thereof, and the Son after he is poſſeſſed of his Fathers E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, doth more for his Father than ever before; will you ſay he doth it that his Farther might give him the inheritance? No, that he hath, and his Father cannot now take it from him, therefore all that now he doth is from ingenuity. That <hi>Holineſſe</hi> therefore which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from this <hi>motive</hi> muſt needs bee <hi>Goſpel-walking,</hi> becauſe it is free of thoſe <hi>qualifications</hi> which are <hi>neceſſary</hi> to a <hi>legal work,</hi> and <hi>legalwalk,</hi>

O what ſhall I render to tht Lord?</hi> How ſhall I ever walk worthy ſo great love? what ſhall I doe for this God who hath done ſo worthily and gloriouſly for my ſoul?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>That I might recover the Image of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;</hi> The firſt man loſt the <hi>Image</hi> of God by his diſobedience, this <hi>Image</hi> of God wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover againe in Chriſt our ſecond Adam, who was obedient; now the more inlightned any ſoul is, the beleeving and holy, the more doth he <hi>recover</hi> of this <hi>Image</hi> of God, which conſiſts in <hi>knowledge, righteouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>true holineſſe.</hi> Now, ſaith the beleeving Soul, my intent is to <hi>recover</hi> the <hi>Image</hi> of God, which the firſt man loſt by his diſobedience, and therefore doe I ſeek to know, and in all things to obey the Goſpel, becauſe in conforming my ſelf here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, I ſhall <hi>recover</hi> the <hi>Image</hi> of God, for as I
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115823:114"/>loſt this <hi>Image</hi> by partaking of the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and pollution of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo ſhall I <hi>recover</hi> the <hi>ſame</hi> by partaking of the obedience and holineſs of the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> which obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience the Goſpel holds forth unto me. Hence I exerciſe my ſelf in duties of Holineſs, becauſe I know the more holy I am, the more ſhall I bee like God, who is Holy, and Holineſſe it ſelfe, and the more ſhall I <hi>recover</hi> of this <hi>Image</hi> which conſiſts in perfect Holineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>That I might imitate Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Chriſt in the Goſpel propoſeth his Holineſs to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as the <hi>pattern</hi> of theirs: <hi>Learne of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart. Love one another at I have loved you.</hi> Now the beleeving Soul reading theſe things over? ſaith to himſelf; it is my duty as much as may be to <hi>imitate Chriſt,</hi> to walk as he hath walked when hee was here upon earth. Now, how did Chriſt walk? why Chriſt was humble, meek, lowly, he prayed to his Father, was thankful to his Father, went about doing good? was full of compaſſion to poor Sinners? denyed himſelf in his reputation and honour with men, and willingly took up the Croſs, the ſhame and reproach of the World, was in all things ſubmiſſive to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will? contenting himſelf therewith, was not impatient in his Sufferings, but took all well and in good part from his Father; was not revengeful towards Inſtruments, for when he was reviled he reviled not again, being falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, buffeted, condemned, nayled to the Croſs, he threatned not, but committed all to him that judgeth righteouſly: being perſecuted,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115823:115"/>curſed, he returned bleſſings for curſings, and prayers for perſecutions, yea hee fulfilled all the righteouſneſs of the Law. Now ſaith the ſoul, It is my duty to <hi>follow Chriſt,</hi> and to draw out my life by the copy of his, and therefore to the end I might <hi>imitate Chriſt,</hi> and bee like him, I obey and love God, for I know Chriſt did ſo; love my enemies, and pray for them, becauſe Chriſt did ſo; do good to all as I have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, becauſe Chriſt did ſo, deſpiſe the honor and reputation of the world, becauſe Chriſt did ſo; continue in prayer, becauſe Chriſt did ſo; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of God humility, patience, meekneſs, thankfulneſs, ſubmiſſiveneſs to the will of God, and contentedneſs therewith, becauſe I finde all this was in Chriſt; ſtrive to be holy in all manner of converſation, and if it were poſſible to bee perfect, becauſe I know Chriſt was ſo. All this I preſs after to the end I might bee <hi>like Chriſt,</hi> that if it were poſſible there might bee nothing in mee but what was in Chriſt, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done by mee, but what Chriſt would have done, nor left undone by mee, but what Chriſt would have left undone.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>That I might keep up my communion with God.</hi> Although the <hi>union</hi> which Saints have with God by <hi>means of Chriſt,</hi> depends wholly upon that which is without, <hi>viz.</hi> their being married to Chriſt and cloathed with his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, yet the <hi>communion</hi> which Saints have with God by <hi>meanes of the Spirit,</hi> hath much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon a Saints <hi>walking:</hi> So that let a Saint <hi>walke carnally</hi> and looſely, though hee ſhall not break the mariage knot, and looſe his <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:115823:115"/>yet hee ſhall grieve the Spirit, and looſe his <hi>communion:</hi> And on the other ſide, let a Saint <hi>walke ſpiritually,</hi> and as becomes the Goſpel, as his <hi>union</hi> remaines ſo ſhall his <hi>communion</hi> alſo bee kept up freſh, and in the life and ſweetneſs of it hee ſhall feel the ſame in his own ſoul. Yea experience tells a Saint, that when as at any time hee hath <hi>walked</hi> as an obedient childe, obſerving and doing with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and in ſimplicity his Fathers will, hee hath then held up much ſweet <hi>communion</hi> with God; and contrariwiſe when hee hath been vain and wanton; and given too much liberty to his own heart therein, though it may bee at that time hee could through faith ſay, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all my ſin, I am the childe of God, yet hath hee not felt in himſelfe, that ſweet and ſpiritual <hi>communion</hi> hee had with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at another time, and good reaſon for it, hee hath walked at a diſtance from God, and therefore though God loves him ſtill and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth him for his childe, yet to the end hee may better learn to know himſelfe, and to know his Father, God will for a time <hi>walke</hi> at a diſtance from him; As when a childe hath been ſtubborn and diſobedient to his Father, though his Father loves him ſtill as his childe, and will not diſ-inherit him for all this, yet the Father to make the childe know himſelf, and know his Father, will carry it at a diſtance for a while, and hee will not bee ſo loving in his look, and familiar in his diſcourſe with his childe as at other times. So when a Saint <hi>walks,</hi> looſely, and unſaintlike, not as a childe to his
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115823:116"/>Father, though God loves him ſtill, yet hee ſhall not have thoſe ſmiles and loving looks, and lappings, and dandlings, and ſweet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, and familiar diſcourſes, that hee had with his Father at another time.</p>
                  <p>Now how ſweet this <hi>communion</hi> is, appears, if wee conſider the eſteem a Saint hath of it when hee feels it, and the price hee puts upon it in want thereof. What high language doth the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> ſpeak of her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and the raviſhments of her heart by his love, whilſt ſhee found and felt this her <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> and mutual imbraces, and love-ſongs, and change of voyces paſſed between her, and her beloved; and how ſorrowfully doth ſhee ſpeak, and how mournfully doth ſhee walk, when as any thing did interpoſe between her, and her beloved, and hinder thoſe mutual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces and kiſſes of love.</p>
                  <p>The ſweetneſs of this communion made a heavenly<note n="*" place="margin">Galeacius Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racciolus, the Italian Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs.</note> man which had great preferments and vaſt ſums of mony offered him to forſake the Goſpel, ſay, Let their mony pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with them who eſteem all the wealth in the world worth <hi>one hours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with Jeſus Chriſt. Now this being ſo, that the <hi>communion</hi> a Saint hath with God, is ſo unſpeakably ſweet, as there is nothing like it, and this having much dependance upon a Saints <hi>walking,</hi> that accordingly as hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means himſelf towards God either in a way of duty, or diſobedience, hee ſhall have more or leſſe thereof; hence he labours to <hi>walk</hi> as a
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115823:116"/>Saint ſhould; for ſaith the Soul, though I know my ſin ſhall never deprive mee of Heaven hereafter, yet if <hi>I walke carnally,</hi> I ſhall looſe my <hi>communion</hi> with God, and that is my heaven here.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>The profiting of others,</hi> is another <hi>Goſpel-end</hi> which runs along in the ſtream of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, who <hi>walke after the Goſpel.</hi> Now the <hi>gracious walking</hi> of a Saint may bee <hi>profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to others</hi> two wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 To thoſe <hi>without,</hi> by way of <hi>convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Let there bee a whole Pariſh made up of Drunkards, and Swearers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and let but a <hi>ſpiritual holy-walking</hi> Saint come amongſt them, and he by his <hi>holy walking</hi> wil <hi>convince</hi> them, and make their conſcience condemn them all: Therefore Chriſt exhorts his, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. to let their light ſhine before men that they may ſee their good works; and <hi>Paul</hi> bids the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians</hi> walk honeſtly towards them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 To thoſe that are <hi>within,</hi> by way of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> Heb. 12.24. <hi>And to Jeſus the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the New Covenant, and to the blood of ſprinkling, that ſpeaketh better things than that of Abel,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.2. <hi>For I know the forwardneſs of your minde, for which I boaſt of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year agoe, and your zeal hath provoked very many.</hi> When a poor ſoul that hath been for a great while very carnal and dead, comes into the preſence of another ſpiritual Saint, that is lively and active for God, and hears him ſpeak; and ſees his walking, hee is hereby <hi>provoked:</hi> He thinks
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115823:117"/>with himſelf; O what a block am I, what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of life hath ſuch a one, and O what a block am I; and this making him aſhamed of himſelf ſets him on work, and ſo becomes a means to put life into that heart, which was dead, carnal, cold and frozen many dayes, weeks, and months before. And truly this is a <hi>bleſſed provocation,</hi> and a Saint who indeed la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and endeavours to <hi>walke</hi> with God, making it his deſign to bee <hi>holy,</hi> both may, and ſhall do God much ſervice in this way.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 And laſtly, <hi>The beating down of the body, and bringing it into ſubjection.</hi> Idleneſs (we ſay) is the mother of all iniquity: We know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience when a man is idle, and not imployed in ſpiritual things, the <hi>fleſh</hi> through that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural depravation that is in the whole man, will incline and draw a man into evill and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt God: When the <hi>Spirit</hi> is not acting in that which is good, and bringing the <hi>fleſh</hi> under, the <hi>fleſh</hi> will take advantage to act in thoſe things that are evill, and ſo bring the the <hi>Spirit</hi> under. Now a Saint knowing and feeling that natural depravation that is in him, and the proneneſſe of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> in caſe it bee not held under, to captivate him thereby, hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth himſelf in thoſe <hi>duties of holineſs,</hi> which concern his general and particular calling, knowing that by keeping a yoak upon the neck of this Rebel, hee ſhall in time weaken him, and make him the more unable to doe him an injury, at leaſt deprive him of his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to do it. The <hi>fleſh</hi> is like an unruly Beaſt, which through reſt and idleneſs grows wilde
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115823:117"/>and Maſterleſs, and there is no way to tame him, but by working him hard; ſo the way to hold the body under, is to keep up the ſoule as much as may bee in the exerciſe of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> This ſeems to have been <hi>Pauls</hi> practice, and to bee the meaning of that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9 laſt. <hi>But I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection; leſt that by any means when I have preached to others, I my ſelfe ſhould bee a caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away.</hi>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115823:119"/>their actions, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God at the bottome, though darkneſs, fear, terror, &amp;c. at the top.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There are <hi>others</hi> who are not onely freed from condemnation, but <hi>injoying and beleeving this their freedome,</hi> and knowing that the <hi>Law</hi> their former husband hath now nothing to do with them, but they are onely under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt, who is their King, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and Husband; their <hi>walke</hi> is a <hi>pure Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-walke,</hi> i.e. there is not that darkneſs, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fear, ſelf-love in <hi>their walking</hi> as in the <hi>walkes</hi> of the <hi>other,</hi> but <hi>their actions</hi> do ſpring from pure love to God, to the glory of God, love to their neighbour, &amp;c.

                  <p>This <hi>Goſpel-walk</hi> it excels a pure <hi>Natural walk,</hi> or a <hi>Legal walk;</hi> in a pure <hi>Natural walk</hi> there the Principle is <hi>Natural</hi> light, &amp; <hi>Natural conſcience;</hi> in a <hi>Legal walk</hi> there the Principle is <hi>fear,</hi> and apprehenſion of <hi>wrath;</hi> but now in a <hi>Goſpel-walk</hi> the principle is the <hi>Spirit;</hi> now by how much the principle is <hi>more excellent,</hi> by ſo much the <hi>action, duty,</hi> the <hi>walk</hi> is <hi>more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;</hi> — As, let a man have two Servants, one ſerves him out of <hi>love,</hi> and from a principle of ingenuity, becauſe he hath received ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from the hand of his Maſter; the other ſerves him for <hi>fear,</hi> or in hope to receive ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from his Maſter; he doth the <hi>moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> ſervice that ſerves him out of <hi>love,</hi> and from ingenuity, becauſe the principle is <hi>most excellent,</hi> whence that hee doth, ariſeth. <hi>Goſpel</hi> obedience is <hi>excellent</hi> obedience, there is a ſtamp of <hi>Divine excellency</hi> upon that, which is upon no other obedience in the world; and the more any Chriſtian comes to this, to <hi>walk</hi> and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey according to the <hi>Gopel,</hi> the more <hi>excellent</hi> Chriſtian he is. A pure <hi>Goſpel-walking</hi> it is the higheſt, ſublimeſt, the <hi>moſt excellent walking</hi> on this ſide the <hi>walk</hi> of glorified Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which ſhould bee a mighty encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us all to preſſe after this <hi>Goſpel-walk.</hi>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This ſhews us, <hi>why there is ſuch a Mystery in Goſpel-walking,</hi> that a meer <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man</hi> cannot conceive what <hi>manner of walk a Goſpel-walk is,</hi> why, becauſe <hi>Goſpel-walking is a walking after the Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Natural man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>perceiveth not the things of the Spirit, neither can hee know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned;</hi> though a <hi>Natural man</hi> hath knowledge and inſight into the things of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the things of <hi>Morality,</hi> becauſe theſe are within the ſphere of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and natural underſtanding, and alſo into the things of he <hi>Goſpel</hi> in a <hi>notional</hi> way, as he takes up theſe things by relation of others, and beleeving and giving credit to thoſe Principles which from relation he hath received, he is able by his parts and reaſon, and <hi>Natural</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to deduce, and inferre from theſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Principles and Concluſions, whereby in a <hi>Notional</hi> way he may by meer parts of <hi>Nature</hi> attaine to a competent meaſure of <hi>Goſpel-knowledge,</hi> yet the things of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> as they are the things of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> i.e. things made out to him not by relation of others, but by the inward revelation, inſpiration, and teaching of the Spirit of God, are <hi>Myſteries</hi> to him; they are things out of his ſphere, which his reaſon and <hi>natural</hi> underſtanding cannot reach; and therefore he is blinde in theſe things.</p>
                  <p>A blinde man we know can gueſſe at things when he hath them declared to him by relation of others which have their ſight, and ſee thoſe things, but though he gueſſe at them, yet hee cannot paſſe a right judgement upon them;
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:115823:121"/>his conceptions are dark and cloudy, various, and too and fro, and not thoſe clear and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt conceptions which another man which hath his ſight, and ſees, and beholds theſe things, hath of them. So a <hi>Natural man,</hi> when hee hears the things of the <hi>Spirit</hi> diſcovered to him by another which ſees and enjoys theſe things; he though he have not the <hi>Spirit,</hi> yet by his reaſon and parts he can Divine, and gueſſe at theſe things; but in reſpect of clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine conceptions hee hath them not, ſo all theſe things are <hi>Myſteries</hi> and Riddles to him.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is, becauſe the <hi>Natural, man</hi> neither doth know, nor can know (wanting the true inward Spiritual light) what manner of things the things of the <hi>Spirit</hi> are, nor what manner of <hi>walk</hi> this <hi>Goſpel-walking,</hi> or <hi>walking after the Spirit is;</hi> therefore is he uncapable of paſſing any right or true judgement upon the actions of the <hi>Spiritual man,</hi> or <hi>Goſpel-walker.</hi> I ſay, a natural man cannot paſs a right judgement upon the actions of one that is a Saint, or Son of God; and led by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> becauſe they are things beyond his ſphere, and out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe and reach of his underſtanding. As (ſaith a godly man) (<hi>Valdeſto, Conſid.</hi> 95.) take a Worme that is bred of the corruption of the Earth, this Creature is not able to conceive of the Generation of the Sons of men, how one man is generated of another, nor of the actions of Mankind, becauſe all theſe things are things alienated from her generation; yea, put the caſe one worme ſhould underſtand this, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115823:121"/>goe about to make other worms capable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet could ſhe never doe it, becauſe theſe are things alienated from their generation; ſo take a <hi>Natural man,</hi> he is altogether unable to paſſe a right judgement upon the actions of the Sons of God, which they doe as led and guided by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> becauſe theſe are things altogether alienated from that which he in a <hi>Natural way</hi> doth? feeles, knowes, or experiments in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; yea ſhould one <hi>Natural man</hi> bee able to paſſe a right judgement upon the actions of a <hi>Spiritual man,</hi> yet could he not make others ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable thereof, becauſe the judgement of <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> things is a thing alienated from their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. Then hence let us learn, <hi>not to put too much in any outward forme;</hi> I am not of their minde who are againſt all <hi>formes;</hi> for <hi>out ward formes</hi> there are as well as duties of Chriſts owne inſtitution; but this I ſay, ſith <hi>Goſpel-walking</hi> is <hi>walking after the Spirit,</hi> let us not <hi>put too much in the forme.</hi> Some men there are that put <hi>too little</hi> in the <hi>forme,</hi> and ſo they throw it by; others put <hi>too much</hi> in it, making that the maine, laying the ſtreſſe of their whole reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion there. Now I deſire this may bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us all, that the <hi>maine Goſpel-walking</hi> is the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and though I am to <hi>walk</hi> in <hi>outward formes</hi> ſo farre as they are of Chriſts inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to uſe them, yet the <hi>maine</hi> of Chriſtian <hi>Goſpel</hi> religion lyes not ſo much in the <hi>outward forme</hi> as in the <hi>inward ſpiritual</hi> worſhip. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115823:123"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Goſpel-worſhip,</hi> makes in principally to conſiſt in this, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. <hi>For God is my witneſs, whom I ſerve with my ſpirit in the Goſpel of his Son, &amp;c.</hi> and Chap. 2.28, 29. <hi>For he is not a Jew which is one outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neither is that circumciſion which is outward in the fleſh; but he is a Jew, which is one inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and circumciſion is that of the heart, in the Spirit, and not in the Letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God;</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>For wee are the circumciſion, which worſhip God in the ſpirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the fleſh;</hi> and ſo Chriſt himſelf oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> worſhip, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.21, 22, 23, 24. ſhewes us that <hi>Goſpel</hi> worſhip is chiefly and <hi>mainly</hi> worſhip in <hi>ſpirit: Jeſus ſaith unto her, Woman, beleeve mee, the hour cometh when yee ſhall neither in this mountaine, nor yet at Jeruſalem worſhip the Father; yee worſhip yee know not what, we know what we worſhip; for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth, for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him. God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and in truth.</hi> And therefore in <hi>Pſam</hi> 45. which is a Propheſie of the Church of the <hi>New Teſtament:</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>the Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is all glorious within;</hi> ſhewing us, that the Saints of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> their glory ſhould be chiefly in <hi>inward</hi> graces. This is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> worſhip, and <hi>New Testament;</hi> in the time of the Old <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> their worſhip did lye moſtly in <hi>outward
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115823:123"/>things,</hi> outward obſervations of times and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c. the <hi>inward worſhip,</hi> it was vailed under the, <hi>outward.</hi> So in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> the <hi>maine.</hi> worſhip is <hi>inward</hi> worſhip, in <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and the <hi>outward</hi> in many things ſeems to be vailed under that, yet as then the <hi>outward</hi> worſhip did not exclude the <hi>inward,</hi> but the <hi>inward</hi> was required, and without in the <hi>outward</hi> was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; ſo now the <hi>inward</hi> worſhip doth not exclude the <hi>outward,</hi> but the <hi>outward</hi> is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and where it may bee performed and is not, I may ſay, <hi>without</hi> it the <hi>inward</hi> is little or nothing, as to Gods acceptance thereof. Therefore I ſay, let us not put <hi>too much</hi> in the <hi>outward forme,</hi> though were are not to deſpiſe it, yet let us not put <hi>too much</hi> therein.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>But when may a man be ſaid to put too much in an outward forme?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. When a mans whole religion lies in that; when a man hath nothing to ſhew him to be religious, or to make him ſo, but ſome <hi>outward forme.</hi> Many there are which goe with ſome <hi>outward forme</hi> upon their backs, and doe but ſtrip them of this their garment, and they have no more <hi>Religion</hi> than the moſt irreligious man living; they have nothing to ſhew them to be <hi>religious,</hi> or to difference them from other men, who have no <hi>religion</hi> at all, but live without God in the world, ſave only this, they are in ſuch an <hi>outward way,</hi> or they doe now and then performe ſuch an <hi>outward duty.</hi> take them out of their way, and from their duty, and they have no more <hi>religion</hi> than a Horſe; all their <hi>religion</hi> it lies in the outſide,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115823:124"/>they have as little in their heart, though they ſeeme to have much on their backs as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. And indeed it is a very uſual thing with many perſons who faine would be <hi>rell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> and love to be ſo accounted, and have no ſtock within to trade with, to drive on a trade for a while as long as they can in this way. Now I ſay, when <hi>all a mans religion</hi> lyes in the <hi>outward forme,</hi> it is evident ſuch a one puts <hi>too much</hi> in it. Thus it was with the <hi>Jews</hi> in Chriſts and the Apoſtles times, their <hi>whole religion</hi> lay in this, that they were the Sons of <hi>Abrcham,</hi> and circumciſed, &amp;c. but ſee what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>For he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, neither is that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion which is outward in the fleſh; but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and circumciſion is that of the heart, in the ſpirit, and not in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>When a mans love and charity is bounded up within the line of his own form, or the way hee is in, or opinion hee holds.</hi> When a man hath no <hi>charity</hi> to ſpare for any but thoſe that jump with him in his <hi>own way, or opinion,</hi> or if hee have <hi>charity</hi> for them, yet becauſe they do not fully accord with him in every thing, hee can allow them but a <hi>little</hi> of his <hi>love,</hi> or of the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of this his <hi>charity.</hi> I have known ſome my ſelf, who have been ſo high againſt baptiſing of Infants, that their <hi>charity</hi> would not allow that man <hi>one grain of grace,</hi> who could not ſet his ſeal preſently to this their <hi>opinion.</hi> I ſpeak not this to throw dirt in the faces of any, but only to ſhew how that ſome men there
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115823:124"/>are who put <hi>too much in Forms. Paul,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly you will all grant it, had as much cauſe to bee confident of the truth of thoſe Ordinances and Traditions hee delivered to the Churches, as any man now living, hath of his <hi>own way</hi> or opinion, and yet hee had ſo much <hi>charity</hi> as to allow him to bee a brother which did not come up to his Traditions, 2 <hi>Theſſ</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>And if any man obey not our word by this Epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be aſhamed; yet count him not as an enemy, but admoniſh him as a brother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>When a man is ſo addicted to his owne way, or forme, that he cannot with patience hear what in a way of Christian love or humility is, or may be ſaid against it.</hi> I ſpeak of ſuch things as are diſputable, where godly men have ſomewhat to ſay <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> as we ſay; now when a man is ſo ſet upon ſome <hi>outward forme</hi> that hee walks in, or hath taken up, as that hee cannot <hi>without flying out,</hi> and ſhewing much <hi>paſſion,</hi> much of man, <hi>hear a word</hi> againſt any thing or principle by him taken up, it argues hee puts <hi>too much</hi> in that <hi>outward forme,</hi> though he may be in the right as to the thing, yet this argues him to put <hi>too much</hi> in it. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> in the two and twentieth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> they gave <hi>Paul</hi> audience till he came to thoſe words, <hi>Depart, for I will ſend thee farre hence unto the Gentiles; and they gave him audience unto this word, and then lift up their voyces, and ſaid, away with ſuch a fellow from the earth, for it is not fit that hee ſhould live,</hi> verſ. 21.22. This becauſe it did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115823:125"/>from their <hi>outward priviledges,</hi> and their way of a National Church, that now the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſhould goe from them unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they can bear no longer, but paſſionately cry out? <hi>Away with ſuch a fellow from the earth, for it is not fit that he ſhould live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>When a mans glorying and boaſting lyes chiefly in that,</hi> when a man makes this the great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his <hi>glorying and boaſting,</hi> that hee is in ſuch or ſuch a way, as many poor ſouls will do, they <hi>boaſt</hi> of this, that they are for, or of ſuch a way, of thoſe that hold ſuch an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. When a man makes any <hi>outward</hi> thing the matter of his <hi>glorying</hi> hee puts <hi>too much</hi> in that. This <hi>Paul</hi> would not do, and therefore when the falſe Apoſtles made a <hi>glorying in outward things,</hi> as Circumciſion, &amp;c. hee ſaith, Gal. 6.14. <hi>God forbid, that I ſhould glory ſave in the croſſe of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the world is crucified to mee, and I unto the world,</hi> hee makes <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> as the Croſs of Chriſt, the Death of Chriſt, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crucified with Chriſt, and dying with Chriſt, and that in oppoſition to <hi>outward things,</hi> as Circumciſion, &amp;c. which the falſe Apoſtles gloried in, the only matter of his <hi>glory,</hi> ſhewing us that when we make our <hi>greateſt boaſt,</hi> and glorying of <hi>outward things,</hi> we put <hi>too much</hi> in thoſe things, and alſo that the <hi>great glorying</hi> of a Chriſtian ſhould bee in <hi>inward things,</hi> his being crucified with Chriſt, being like Chriſt, &amp;c. Yea ſuch <hi>glorying</hi> in <hi>outward things,</hi> hee calls a <hi>glorying</hi> after the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.18. <hi>Seeing that many glory after the fleſh, I will glory alſo;</hi> the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115823:125"/>beſt of <hi>outward things,</hi> when we come to <hi>glory</hi> in theſe, and make our <hi>boaſt</hi> of theſe, our <hi>glorying</hi> and boaſting will be found but a carnal <hi>fleſhly boaſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>When a man likes that truth, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he loves, the worſe, becauſe it comes not to him fully in his owne way;</hi> it argues he puts <hi>too much</hi> in that <hi>outward</hi> way. As ſuppoſe, two godly men deliver the ſame Truth, one in an Independent (as they ſay) the other a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, and put the caſe I were a Presbyter, I diſlike the Truth becauſe it is an Independent, one of another way ſpeaks it; another is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, hee diſlikes becauſe a Presbyter ſpeaks it; both theſe ſhew that they put <hi>too much</hi> in their <hi>owne way,</hi> becauſe they love the Truth, which only is to be loved and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for it ſelf, the better, or the worſe, becauſe it comes <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>out</hi> of their way. Truth was truth in <hi>Apollos</hi> his mouth, and <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> heard him, when hee preached in the Synagogue, yet it is ſaid that hee knew only the Baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> and had but a dark and confuſed, not a perfect knowledge in the way of the Lord till afterwards, <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcilla took him, and expounded the way of God to him more perfectly,</hi> Acts 24.25, 26. From which inſtance, I conclude this, that a man may, and it was the practiſe of Primitive Saints, to hear thoſe who were not Members of viſible Churches, but ſtrangers to them, if ſo be the things they taught were truth; for <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> Church-members, hear <hi>Apollo,</hi> who was either a ſtranger to them, and if ſo,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115823:126"/>then it was an uſe to hear ſtrangers; of it known to them (which is moſt likely hee was not till afterwards) then did they know that hee knew only the Baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> and was not clear as yet in his principles for the way of the Lord, and yet they heard him.</p>
                  <p>Vſe 5. <hi>Then you which are Goſpel Saints fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Spirit;</hi> the <hi>miſtakes</hi> of the Saints doe not ariſe from the <hi>want</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> to teach them and guide them, ſo much as from their <hi>not obſerving the way</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; Saints have the <hi>Spirit</hi> promiſed to teach and lead them, but they do not <hi>follow</hi> their Leader; and hence grow all thoſe <hi>miſtakes and errours</hi> that are in Beleevers, from their <hi>not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing</hi> their Leader. Had wee but ſo much heavenly wiſdome and grace as <hi>obſerve</hi> the goings of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and to <hi>follow</hi> him in his owne way or path, we ſhould not <hi>miſſe the will of God</hi> ſo frequently as wee doe; ſeldome doth a Saint <hi>miſtake</hi> but he ſhall finde, if he doe but look back where his <hi>miſtake</hi> began, that there he did ceaſe to <hi>follow</hi> his Leader; either he did turne aſide to pride, curioſity or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which he ſhould not have done, and there the <hi>Spirit</hi> which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before ſenſibly went along with him, left him, ſo that he went about gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping after that truth; which before he ſaw by another inward ſecret light, only by the light of his owne reaſon and natural underſtanding; ſo that ſometimes a Soul which is taught by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> can ſay, here and here I left to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my Leader, and ever ſince I have been in the dark; whilſt I went along humbly ſeeking
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115823:126"/>after truth and the will of God, as God ſhould make out the ſame to me, I ſaw thingsclear, and with much evidence and inward light things were made out to me, but at ſuch a time I remember after I had got a little light into ſuch a truth, I grew proud, and ſelf-conceited, and wanton with what I had attained, and there I ſenſibly found the <hi>Spirit</hi> left me, and ever ſince I have been ſeeking after that truth, but have not had that inward light to direct me, nor than evidence nor clearneſs concerning the things I have found out as before I had.</p>

This <hi>light</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is called <hi>Revelation,</hi> Matth. 11.27. <hi>No man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father ſave the Son, and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him,</hi> 1 Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. 2.10. <hi>But God hath revealed them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by his Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 1.17, 18. <hi>That

               <p n="7">7 <hi>They are Chriſts own by poſſeſſion.

               <p n="3">3 That Chriſt <hi>hath a love</hi> to his own, appears</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>From the very nature of propriety,</hi> which loves that thing I have a <hi>propriety</hi> in above other. A Father loves his childe above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Why? hee hath a <hi>propriety</hi> in it, it is his <hi>own.</hi> The husband loves his wife, ſhee is <hi>his own.

               <p n="2">2 <hi>From that ſpecial reſpect</hi> hee hath to them above others.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Hee hath <hi>special pity and compaſſion</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in all their ſufferings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9.) <hi>In all their affection hee was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them; in his love, and in his pity hee redeemed them and bee bare them, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them all the dayes of old.</hi> Heb. 4.15. <hi>For wee have not an High Prieſt which cannot bee touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as wee are, yet without ſinne,</hi> Chap. 5.2. <hi>Who can have compaſſion on the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and on them that are out of the way, for that hee himſelfe alſo is compaſſed with infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:115823:133"/>Touch not mine Anointed, and do my Prophets no harm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Hee hath a <hi>ſpecial care</hi> of them to ſee they ſhall <hi>not want.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 That this love of Chriſt to his own, is a <hi>choice,</hi> and an <hi>everlaſting love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 It is a <hi>choice love,</hi> for,</p>
               <p n="1">1 It is <hi>Father-like love,</hi> Pſal. 103.13. <hi>Like as a father pitieth his children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 It is a <hi>conjugal love.</hi> What love more choice than Marriage-love, it is to bee loved as a man loves himſelf, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.28. <hi>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.</hi> Chriſt hath married beleevers, his love to them is Marriage-love.</p>
               <p n="3">3 It is <hi>dying love.</hi> Such love as makes him <hi>dye</hi> for the party loved. This is the greateſt love of all, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> If greateſt love bee <hi>dying love,</hi> then Chriſt did not dye for all (as ſome will have it) for hee doth not love all with the greateſt love.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It is <hi>Everlaſting love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Love ariſing from an <hi>everlaſting cauſe,</hi> where the <hi>cauſe</hi> is everlaſting, the <hi>effect</hi> muſt bee ſo too. What is the <hi>cauſe</hi> why Chriſt loves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers? Why, meerly his <hi>good will and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> hee loves becauſe hee will love. This <hi>cauſe</hi> being <hi>everlaſting,</hi> the <hi>effect</hi> muſt bee alſo <hi>everlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Love ſupported by <hi>everlaſting Pillars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 The Pillar of his <hi>Unchangeableneſſe,</hi> Heb.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115823:134"/>13.3. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever,</hi> Mal. 3.6. <hi>For I am the Lord, I change not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 The Pillar of his <hi>Truth and Faithfulneſſe.</hi> Chriſt is the true and faithful one. It is a part of unfaithfulneſſe to love a while, and then to ceaſe to love; Chriſt is no ſuch lover.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Pillar of his <hi>everlaſting remembrance.</hi> Iſa. 49.15.16. <hi>Can a woman forget her ſucking-childe, that ſhee ſhould not have compaſſion on the Son of her womb? yea they may forget, yet will not I forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the Palms of my hands, thy walls are continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FOR APPLICATION.</hi> As there are two things mainly held forth in the Text, both which I have in the doctrinal part ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. 1 That beleevers are <hi>Chriſts own.</hi> 2 That Chriſt loves his own with a <hi>peculiar and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love.</hi> So in my <hi>Application</hi> I ſhall ſpeak ſomeching to both.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, Is it ſo that beleevers are <hi>Chriſts own?</hi> Then,</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Chriſt will not ſee his own want.</hi> Will a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee his childe want, when it lyes in his power to help him? Will a loving husband ſee his wife <hi>want,</hi> when it lyes in his power to ſupply her? Hee will not, ſhee is his <hi>own;</hi> the childe is the fathers <hi>own;</hi> the wife is the husbands <hi>own;</hi> And think you will Chriſt ſee <hi>his own want?</hi> Is his care leſs than a fathers? love leſs than a husbands? Doeſt thou <hi>want</hi> inward, outward <hi>wants,</hi> go to Chriſt and ſay, Lord I am <hi>thy own,</hi> and wilt thou not provide this and that for mee?</p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:115823:134"/>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Let wicked men take heed how they wrong beleevers.</hi> Though a father can bear to ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther childe <hi>wronged,</hi> yet not his own; a husband another woman <hi>abuſed,</hi> yet not his own wife, this provokes him, hee cannot bear it, but cries out, Why do you <hi>wrong</hi> my childe? Why doe you <hi>abuſe</hi> my wife? Chriſt will not bear it to ſee his <hi>own wronged,</hi> but thoſe that wrong them ſhall pay dearly for it. When God brought <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt, Iſrael</hi> was Gods Son, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.1 <hi>When Iſrael was a childe, then I loved him, and called my Son out of Egypt. Amaleck</hi> as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in the way falls upon him, God gives <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleck</hi> a cruſhing blow at preſent, and obſerve it, four hundred years after God thinks of this, and deſtroyes <hi>Amaleck</hi> for it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.2, 3. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hosts, I remember that which Amaleck did to Iſrael, how hee laid wait for him in the way when he came up from Egypt. Now go and ſmite Amalecke, and utterly deſtroy all that they have, and ſpare them not, but ſlay both man and woman, infant, and ſuckling, oxe and ſheep, Camel, and Aſſe.</hi> Yea obſerve <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. Chriſt at the laſt day will paſſe ſentence for, or againſt men, as they have behaved themſelves to his.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Let not Saints injure one another.</hi> If a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have many children, and the one <hi>wrongs</hi> the other, hee takes it ill, Why? becauſe all are <hi>his own,</hi> and hee will not ſee <hi>his own wronged</hi> by his <hi>own;</hi> ſo Chriſt will not take it kindely at the hands of thoſe Saints who <hi>wrong and injure</hi> their brethren, becauſe they are all <hi>his own,</hi> and hee will not ſee any of <hi>his own</hi> wronged by
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115823:135"/>any whomſoever; <hi>David</hi> was a man after Gods owne heart, yet an <hi>injury</hi> done to <hi>Uriah</hi> a godly man, coſt him dear. <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi> were both Saints, yet but for ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Moſes</hi> in an unbeſeeming manner, the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt them, and <hi>Miriam</hi> is ſmitten with the Leproſie, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. For the ſecond, Is the love of Chriſt to his owne, <hi>a choyſe and an everlaſting love?</hi> then,</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>A Saint can never fall from the love of Chriſt;</hi> though he may <hi>fall</hi> ſo as to looſe the <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of it, yet never the <hi>love</hi> it ſelf, which is <hi>everlasting.</hi> If a Soul once in Chriſts love might <hi>fall</hi> from it, how ſhould his love be <hi>everlaſting?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>How bleſſed is the condition of the pooreſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever;</hi> he is a man beloved of Chriſt, every beleever may be called Jedidiah, <hi>the beloved of the Lord,</hi> one loved with an <hi>everlaſting love.</hi> Is in accounted a priviledge among men to have the love of a great man, whoſe love is like himſelf, fading and changeable? O what is it to have the love of Chriſt, King of Kings? whoſe love alſo is as himſelf, immutable, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. Chriſts Favourites are never caſt out of favour.</p>
               <p n="3">3 How then doe Saints <hi>injure Ieſus Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>By calling his love upon every turne into queſtion;</hi> I fear Chriſt doth not <hi>love</hi> me, ſuch a time, ſuch a day, in ſuch a duty, I <hi>had</hi> his <hi>love,</hi> but now I fear I have <hi>loſt</hi> it. What <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi> is this to the <hi>love</hi> of Chriſt? He ſaith, my <hi>love it everlaſting,</hi> Soul, I will <hi>love</hi> thee freely,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115823:135"/>and I will <hi>love</hi> thee for ever, for ever; thou ſayeſt, once I <hi>had</hi> his <hi>love,</hi> but now I have <hi>loſt</hi> it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>By meaſuring his love by theirs;</hi> When I make my <hi>love</hi> to Chriſt a meaſure, to <hi>meaſure.</hi> Chriſts <hi>love</hi> to me by. If I <hi>love</hi> Chriſt much, then I think Chriſt <hi>loves</hi> mee much; if I <hi>love</hi> Chriſt a little, then I think he <hi>loves</hi> me but a little; and if I <hi>love</hi> Chriſt not at all, then I think he <hi>loves</hi> me not at all. What a diſhonour is this to the <hi>love</hi> of Chriſt, to hang it upon my <hi>love,</hi> as it the ſame were greatned or leſſened by my <hi>love,</hi> were much, little, or not at all, as mine is. I confeſs, in reſpect of the <hi>manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>love</hi> it is ſo oftentimes, but for the <hi>love</hi> it <hi>ſelf</hi> that is not ſo changeable? for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable and everlaſting.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Take heed of ſinning againſt this love;</hi> If Chriſts <hi>love</hi> be everlaſting, <hi>ſin</hi> not againſt ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting <hi>love,</hi> grieve not everlaſting love by <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> You think perhaps the thing you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit is but little, O know this, the leſſe the thing is for which you grieve everlaſting love, the greater is your <hi>ſin,</hi> that for ſo little a thing you will grieve everlaſting love. Conſider Saints, Chriſt ſaith (as it were) to you, Souls if you will <hi>ſin,</hi> you ſhall <hi>ſin</hi> againſt everlaſting love, you ſhall trample my love.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Serve God freely, and without fear, out of pure love;</hi> if Gods love did depend upon our <hi>walking,</hi> then we might <hi>fear,</hi> but when it doth not ſo, but is everlaſting, what hinders but that we ſhould ſerve cheerfully without <hi>fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Labour to get a portion of this love;</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115823:137"/>verſe 1. it is called, <hi>the burden of the Lord for Iſrael,</hi> Mal. chap. 1.1. calls his the <hi>burden of the Lord to Iſrael,</hi> becauſe what he ſpake was moſtly againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in way of reproving them for their ſins, and ſo it was directed to them; this is <hi>the burden of the Lord for Iſrael,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what is here ſpoken, it is either ſomething that God will doe <hi>againſt his enemies</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſake; or ſomewhat which God in a way of Grace and Mercy will doe to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or beſtow upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though I take it, it is called <hi>the burden of the Lord for Iſrael</hi> in the firſt reſpect, in reſpect of what God in the laſt dayes will doe for <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt <hi>his enemies,</hi> for if we take it for what God in a way of Mercy will doe to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it cannot ſo properly be called <hi>a burden;</hi> now here we finde God in <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. being now to appear for <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt his enemies, coming forth in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his <hi>power,</hi> be comes forth (as the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>like a Giant refreſhed with wine,</hi> and (as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaies) <hi>as one that would work and none ſhould let it;</hi> the firſt ſight wee have of him, wee behold him in the greatneſſe of his <hi>power, ſaith the Lord, which ſtretcheth forth the Heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth,</hi> he comes as one travelling in the greatneſſe of his ſtrength, mighty to ſave; and as hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the greatneſs of his ſtrength, ſo of his <hi>Wiſdome</hi> too, <hi>that formeth the ſpirit of man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him,</hi> as to ſay? his Wiſdome is farre beyond the wiſdome of any man, or of all men put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for whatever is in any man or men it is from him, he hath put it in them, <hi>hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115823:138"/>the ſpirit of man within him.</hi> Thus God comes forth, being to march againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the behalf of his people, in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> as one that is able to doe it, and will carry the day; and to the end that all his Adverſaries might quake and tremble at the very newes and noyſe of ſuch an enemy, ſo wonderful in power and policy coming againſt them.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, What doth God doe now he is up? why, as he ariſeth in the greatneſſe of his power and wiſdome, ſo being up, hee doth great and wonderful things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the very beginning he calls for <hi>a behold</hi> from his people, verſ. 2. <hi>Behold</hi> — denoting that he would have his people in an eſpecial manner to <hi>attend</hi> unto, and <hi>obſerve</hi> the things he was at preſent doing, and about to doe. Now what are they? why you finde in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words and verſes, ſome things that he would doe <hi>againſt his enemies,</hi> and ſome things <hi>for his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As firſt, he would <hi>make</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a cup of trembling, &amp;c.</hi> As a man that drinks up a cup of Poyſon, through the operation of that within him, is inwardly filled with <hi>trembling,</hi> the Natural ſpirits and vitals, whilſt they are in combate with the Poyſon, doe <hi>tremble;</hi> ſo all thoſe which ſhould head, and be gathered together againſt Gods <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> thinking to drink up <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour her, they ſhall finde <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to be unto them like a cup of Poyſon, it ſhould ſet them all on <hi>trembling,</hi> and inſtead of ruining
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115823:138"/>
                  <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> they ſhould bee ruined by her.</p>
               <p>And againe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>In that day</hi> (i.e. in the laſt dayes, as I ſhall clear afterwards) <hi>will I make</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a burdenſome ſtone?</hi>—as a man that offers to take up a great ſtone too heavie and weighty by farre for him to bear; ſinkes downe under the ſame and is cruſhed to peeces by it; ſo thoſe, whoſoever they be, though all the earth bee gathered together, which ſhall make War againſt Gods <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> thinking to diſpoſe of and carry her about at their pleaſure, ſhall finde her to bee ſo weighty a burden, that they ſhall even ſinke down under her, and bee cruſhed in peeces by her.</p>
               <p>And again verſ. 3. <hi>I will ſmite every horſe with aſtoniſhment, and his Rider with madneſſe, and I will open mine eyes upon the houſe of Judah.</hi> Horſe and Horſemen wee know are the ſtrength of an Army. Now when a Horſe is filled with <hi>aſtoniſhment,</hi> wee ſee hee flyes back, and inſtead of offending the enemy, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes friends, and ſo proves the ruine of thoſe who march out with him: And when a Horſe is <hi>blinde,</hi> hee is of no uſe at all to doe any ſervice in a way of offence or defence. And when a man is mad, and hath loſt the uſe of his reaſon, hee can make no more difference than a very beaſt betwixt friends and foes, but falls upon all alike, and ever upon thoſe that are next to him: So that it is as if God ſhould ſay, In that day when multitudes of wicked men, and the enemies of my <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together againſt her, thinking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy her, and root her out for ever, then will
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115823:139"/>I do this, <hi>I will open my eyes</hi>—<hi>i.e.</hi> I will caſt a gracious and a merciful eye upon my <hi>Judah;</hi> and for her ſake I will make <hi>Horſe and Horſemen, i.e.</hi> the whole ſtrength and power of the enemy altogether unſerviceable for the doing of any hurt or prejudice to my <hi>Sion,</hi> or for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of themſelves from <hi>Sions</hi> ſtroak, which ſhall fall upon them, and ſerviceable onely for the ruining and deſtroying of themſelves, and of one another.</p>
               <p>And again verſe 5. Here wee have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie concerning the Governours of <hi>Judah,</hi> as concernig <hi>Judahs</hi> enemies in the former verſes; and what is it? Why this, <hi>The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Judah ſhall ſay in their heart</hi> — it ſeems to mee, from this verſe, and likewiſe from the ſeventh, that the firſt glorious appearing of God at this time, it ſhall bee amongſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, the <hi>tents of Judah,</hi> as verſ. 7. <hi>i.e.</hi> ſuch as have not ſumptuous <hi>Pallaces</hi> to dwell in, but are right <hi>Jacobs,</hi> plain men dwelling in <hi>Tents,</hi> poor people, or the meaner ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; not the pooreſt of all who have no <hi>Tents,</hi> no place of habitation, but are very vagrants and beggars; nor the richeſt, who have their <hi>Pallaces</hi> and royal houſes, but a middle ſort of people, living in a plain, but an honourable and comely way, as the way of living in <hi>Tents</hi> was, theſe ſhall God firſt gloriouſly appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt; and the reaſon ſeems to bee given in the ſeventh verſe, <hi>That the glory of the houſe of David</hi>—<hi>i.e.</hi> that ſuch as are of <hi>Princely</hi> and noble blood, dwelling in <hi>Courts</hi> and ſumptuous <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces,</hi> or depending upon ſuch places, <hi>may not
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115823:139"/>magnifie themſelves againſt, i.e.</hi> may not (as all along from the beginning of the world to this time, it hath been an uſual cuſtome, for noble men, great men, learned men, to <hi>magnifie themſelves againſt,</hi> and deſpiſe others) <hi>exalt themſelves</hi> above poor, meaner, ignoble, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned men, thinking themſelves better than they, and deſpiſing of the other in their eyes: no, but that they may clearly ſee, that what theſe want in other things which they have, God hath over, and above made up to them in his glorious appearances amongſt them, and diſcoveries of himſelf to them. Now I ſay, God ſhall firſt begin to work not upon the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> themſelves, but upon the common people, or the <hi>middle ſort</hi> of people, which ſhall bee under their rule and government, Gods firſt glorious appearances ſhall bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe, which ſhall dwell in <hi>Tents,</hi> and the <hi>Governours</hi> they ſeeing this, how wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully God doth appear for this people, and owns them, ſhattering all that do but lift up a hand againſt them to peeces, and brings all plots and counſels againſt them to nothing, they ſhall bee ſo ſtrangely convinced, that they <hi>ſhall ſay in their hearts, i. e. privately,</hi> it may bee either for ſhame, or for ſome other carnal by-reſpect, they ſhall not own them <hi>publickly,</hi> any farther than as they are Magiſtrates, to uſe means for their defence, or as they clearly ſee them to bee loyal ſubjects, ſo to allow them as ſubjects their liberty to ſerve and worſhip God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they are convinced his will is, and they ought to do; but yet they <hi>ſhall ſay in their hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:115823:140"/>the inhabitants of Jeruſalem my ſtrength</hi> (for this (<hi>ſhall bee</hi>) is but put into the Text) <hi>in the Lord of Hoſts their God;</hi> as to ſay, Well, now wee plainly ſee where our <hi>strength lyes,</hi> this is the very people wee muſt own and ſtick too, or aſſuredly wee go down, for this wee clearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Lord of Hoſts is their God, and if wee do but ſtick to this people, wee ſhall have their God going along with us, and therefore without any longer controverſie here <hi>lyes our ſtrength,</hi> wee ſtand or fall, in owning or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning this people.</p>
               <p>Again verſ. 7. Wee have ſomewhat more ſpoken concerning the <hi>Governours of Judah</hi> by way of Propheſie, and that is, Gods glorious appearance for them, and in their behalf, they no ſooner come to own the people of God, though it bee but ſecretly, to ſay, ſurely theſe are Gods people, here <hi>lyes our ſtrength,</hi> wee will therefore ſtick to theſe, but preſently God ſticks to them, and appears for them, and makes them terrible to all theirs, and his peoples ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries (no ſooner doth any ſtate own Gods people, but hee owns them.) Now what is it, is ſpoken of the <hi>Governours of Judah?</hi> Why this, <hi>I will make the Governours of Judah like a hearth of fire</hi> — You know, take ever ſo much wood and lay it on a <hi>hearth of fire,</hi> and the <hi>hearth of fire</hi> makes away with it, and it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed: And take a ſheaf or ſtack of corn, though ever ſo great, and put but a torch into it, and that will conſume it all immediately; ſo ſaith God, ſhall the <hi>Governours of Judab</hi> bee, they ſhall conſume and devoure all the people,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115823:140"/>on the right hand, and on the left, &amp;c. wee ſee here (by the by) what is the way to make a ſtate or a Kingdome happy, to make them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous and terrible to all Gods enemies, why, to own the people of God.</p>
               <p>In verſ. 8. Wee have a precious Prophetical promiſe made to the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as of Gods <hi>protection</hi> over them, <hi>In that day ſhall the Lord defend.</hi> — So likewiſe of his <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful bleſsing</hi> that ſhall in the laſt dayes bee upon them, in the abundant increaſe of their gifts and graces: God will not onely preſerve their bodies from the rage and fury of wicked men, but hee will exceedingly inrich their ſoules with the heavenly <hi>bleſsings</hi> of his Grace and Spirit; <hi>He that is feeble among them at that day, ſhall be as David,</hi> — that is, poor, weak, feeble Saints ſhall at this time have as much knowledge, and grace <hi>as David, i.e.</hi> as the moſt eminent of all informer ages, for <hi>David</hi> was the moſt eminent in his age, <hi>And the houſe of David ſhall be as God,</hi> — that is, ſuch as before were eminent in gifts and grace, ſhall now have their gifts and graces ſo exceedingly increaſed, that they ſhall ſeem rather like Angels than men.</p>
               <p>In the following verſes to the end of the Chapter, wee have a <hi>repetition</hi> of what went before, in which, that which had been more largely treated of in the foregoing verſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods <hi>preſervation</hi> his people from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and <hi>ruining</hi> of his enemies, is but briefly touched verſ. 9. and that which had been but touched before, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>powring out of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115823:141"/>the Spirit</hi> in verſ. 8. is now more fully opened and handled, in the verſe of the Text, and the following verſes.</p>
               <q>And I will pour upon the houſe of David—</q>
               <p>The Text (as the whole Chapter) is a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Propheſie made to the laſt times. In it wee have,</p>
               <p n="1">1 A <hi>promiſe</hi> of a gracious effuſion or pouring forth of the Spirit, wherein wee have,</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Who poures</hi> and that is God. <hi>I will poure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Upon whom, i.e.</hi> The <hi>houſe of David,</hi> by which may bee underſtood men of a higher ranke; the <hi>houſe of David</hi> was the Royal houſe, and thoſe that came there of were of the Blood-royal.— <hi>And the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, i.e.</hi> men of a lower ranke; the meaning is, God will in theſe dayes poure out his Spirit upon all ſorts, high and low, Prince and people, as <hi>Joel</hi> ſaith, Chap. 2. end. <hi>All fleſh.</hi> Theſe words litterally they are ſpoken of the Jewes when they ſhall bee converted, ſpiritually they belong to Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>What he poures,</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which hath here two things attributed to it, or two titles given it. Firſt, <hi>A Spirit of grace,</hi> ſo called, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe it is the original, or begetter of all grace in us, or becauſe it is given us of grace: The gift of the Spirit, is a gift of free grace. I rather incline to this than the former, becauſe ſo it is more diſtinct from the next, <hi>of ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> becauſe prayer or ſupplication is one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial grace of the Spirit; which if wee take the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115823:141"/>firſt, the Spirit of Grace, that is ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it begets grace, then the latter, viz. <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,</hi> which is one ſpecial grace begotten by the Spirit in the hearts of Saints, is included in it, unleſs we ſhall take the firſt of grace, for the habits of grace which are firſt wrought in the Soule by the Spirit; and the latter or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, for the actings of thoſe graces, one Spiritual work wherein much grace is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, being put for the exerciſe of all grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>When hee pours;</hi> this though it bee out of the text, yet it is a neceſſary queſtion, and it is anſwered in the fore-going verſe, where the time in which God will doe this is called <hi>that day.</hi> It is a phraſe which is much uſed in the Prophets, no leſſe than forty times (as I take it) in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and near twenty in this Prophet; and it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>that day</hi> for <hi>eminency ſake,</hi> becauſe this time when it ſhall come, it ſhall be a very eminent and remarkable time, ſuch a time for peace, joy, plenty, and proſperity, glory, and liberty to the Saints, and bondage and captivity to the enemies of Gods people as the World ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw, and therefore it is called <hi>that day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 Noting an <hi>eminent</hi> glorious day, farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling all daies that ever had gone before it; and when it is called <hi>a day,</hi> we are not to underſtand it a <hi>Natural day,</hi> i. e. conſiſting of twenty four hours; nor of an ordinary <hi>Prophetical day,</hi> that is, a day for a year; but of an <hi>extraordinary day,</hi> ſuch a day as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3. <hi>One day is with the Lord as a thouſand years, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115823:142"/>a thouſand years as one day.</hi> Now, the time which is ſet forth in Scripture by this phraſe of ſpeech, <hi>that day,</hi> is ſometimes taken for a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſometimes for a ſtricter time; ſometimes it is taken ſo ſtrictly that it may containe not much more time, if ſo much, as a meer <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral day,</hi> and ſo we have the day of that great Battel of <hi>Armageddon,</hi> often called where it is ſpoken of, <hi>that day,</hi> Rev. 16.14. and <hi>Ioel</hi> 3. and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places; ſometimes it is taken ſtrictly, but not ſo ſtrictly, and then it is put for the whole time of Chriſts Kingdome here on earth, from the time that he ſets up his Kingdome to the end; and this is ſo frequently ſpoken of in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that I need name no place, only I will turne you to one, becauſe not farre from the text. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe in that day, that the light ſhall not be clear, nor dark; But it ſhall be one day, which ſhall bee known to the Lord, not day nor night; but it ſhall come to paſſe that at evening time it ſhall be light, and it ſhall be in that day, that living waters ſhall goe out from</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>halfe of them toward the former Sea, and half of them toward the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sea; in ſummer and in winter ſhall it be, and the Lord ſhall be King over all the earth, in that day ſhall there bee one Lord, and his name one.</hi> Here we have Chriſts Kingdome ſet up, and the whole time of it is but <hi>one day,</hi> and that <hi>one day</hi> is <hi>all</hi> along called <hi>that day;</hi> ſometimes it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more largely, not only for the time of Chriſts Kingdome after hee ſets the ſame up, but for the laſt dayes alſo, the dayes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before that time, wherein many glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115823:142"/>things, as the ſpreading of the Goſpel, the ruine of Antichriſt, and the call of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which if it be not before, yet it ſhall be juſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſts ſetting up of his Kingdome, and ſo may have reference to the time before, or after the laſt dayes, or the time of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and in this ſenſe it is here to be taken as I conceive, for the time juſt upon Chriſts ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up his Kingdome, when Gods peoples enemies ſhall be ruined, the <hi>Iewes</hi> called, and mourn, as here we read of.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>A glorious effect,</hi> following this effuſion, or pouring forth of the Spirit, which is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Upon the Senſes, <hi>They ſhall look upon mee whom they have peirced;</hi> which words litterally are ſpoken of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who at the time of their Call ſhall behold that Jeſus Chriſt whom their Nation have peirced. Spiritually, it is true of all Beleevers looking upon that Chriſt by faith whom their ſins have peirced.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Upon the Affections, <hi>They ſhall mourn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which mourning is ſet forth by the greatneſſe of it, it ſhall be ſuch a mourning, <hi>as when a man mourns for his only Son,</hi> no grief or ſorrow goes ſo near, as grief for loſſe of an only Childe; Ah! will a man ſay, had I loſt of my eſtate it would never have troubled mee, but it is my Son, my only Son, I have never another, and then it ſhall be <hi>bitterneſſe;</hi> you know the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>bitter</hi> things, things which are bitter the taſte of them will remaine a great while, it ſticks by a man; but now <hi>bitterneſſe,</hi> that is more, and denotes a higher degree than <hi>bitter,</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:115823:143"/>as the abſtract is more than the concret; ſo that this expreſſion ſhewes, that it ſhall bee an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great mourning,</hi> and that ſo too as it ſhall ſtick by them it ſhall not lightly paſſe off their ſpirits and glide away, and ſo be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and there is no more of it, as other ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row doth, but it ſhall bee an <hi>exceeding great,</hi> and a <hi>remaining mourning,</hi> of which more is ſpoken in the next verſes.</p>
               <p>The words thus opened, yeeld us ſeveral uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obſervations.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 1. <hi>That the pouring out of the Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſoul, is the proper and peculiar work of God;</hi> it is not Men, nor means, nor Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that can effect this, but God alone, and therefore it is ſtill attributed to him, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.28. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 32.15. <hi>until the Spirit bee poured upon us from on high, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt himſelf as a Man had the <hi>Spirit</hi> poured upon him by the Father, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delighteth; I have put my Spirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth judgement to the Gentiles.</hi> How many poor Souls are there that have good education, godly friends, and Parents, ſit under means and Ordinances, and yet are ſtrangers to the <hi>Spirit;</hi> many there are who all the year long come hither and hear the Word, and there is no change in them, they were Drunkards, Swearers, &amp;c. at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the year, and ſo they are ſtill; God hath not poured down of his <hi>Spirit</hi> upon them. O poor Souls, would you ever have the <hi>Spirit</hi> begge it of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:115823:143"/>
               <p>Obſ. 2. <hi>In the laſt dayes the pouring out of the Spirit ſhall be very general</hi>— on the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> high and low: <hi>Ioel</hi> ſaith, <hi>all fleſh,</hi> chap. 2. end. Sons, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Young men, Old men. In the times of the Law God gave his <hi>Spirit</hi> but only to <hi>ſome few</hi> extraordinary men, as Prophets, &amp;c. in the beginning of the Goſpel, God poured it downe upon <hi>many more,</hi> upon Apoſtles, and many Brethren, but <hi>not all;</hi> but now in the laſt daies <hi>upon all fleſh</hi> (for I take it, that this Propheſie of <hi>Ioel</hi> relates to the laſt daies, though in the beginnings of it it was fulfilled in the Apoſtles time) add ſo <hi>Ierem.</hi> 31.34. <hi>And they ſhall teach no more every man his Neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord, for they ſhall ſhall know me, from the leaſt of them unto the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of them, ſaith the Lord;</hi> ſpeaking of the laſt daies it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall all know me.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.20. <hi>The childe ſhall dye an hundred years old,</hi> i. e. in knowledge, very Children ſhall have the <hi>Spirit</hi> poured downe upon them. O what a glorious time will this be, when all the Saints ſhall be filled with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> when you cannot goe to a Saint but you ſhall finde Gods <hi>Spirit</hi> breathing in him; and how ſhould this ſtirre up every one of us upon whom theſe laſt daies are coming, if not come, to labour after the <hi>Spirit?</hi> Is it not a ſhame that the nearer this time comes, the more Carnal inſtead of <hi>Spiritual</hi> we ſhould be?</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3. <hi>All grace it from the Spirit of God,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit of grace</hi> — we have no <hi>grace</hi> in our <hi>Nature,</hi> but all is from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as the fruits
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115823:144"/>thereof, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>But the fruit of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſſe, goodneſſe, faith, meekneſſe, temperance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 4. <hi>The gift of the Spirit is the gift of Free Grace.</hi> This is taken from thoſe words, the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> interpreted in the latter ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 5. <hi>One maine and ſpecial work that the Spirit of God puts Souls upon where it is, is the work of Supplication, or Prayer</hi> — and <hi>Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> — the <hi>Spirit</hi> coming from God, it loves much to be carrying out thoſe Souls where it is to God; <hi>Prayer,</hi> it is a Natural work to that Soul where the <hi>Spirit</hi> is; and as the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God puts Souls <hi>upon Prayer,</hi> ſo the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God acts the Saints <hi>in Prayer;</hi> or as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Prayes in them,</hi> ſometimes by enabling them with words, ſometimes by filling them with groanes unutterable, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Soul that prayes by the Spirit, hee hath inward groanings for many things more than hee can utter, it may be he ſpeaks one Petition, and at that inſtant groanes for twenty; the groanings of the ſpirits in the Saints hearts whilſt they are in prayer, being farre more large and extenſive, than the expreſſions of the mouth are, or can bee; and which may bee a matter of abundant comfort to us, the anſwer of God is not according to the expreſſions of our mouth, but the deſires and groanings of his owne Spirit. O would we know then how to <hi>pray</hi> as we ſhould! let us labour for the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> we ſhall never <hi>pray</hi> without it, perhaps we may ſpeak good words, and fine expreſſions,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115823:144"/>as many can, who yet never <hi>prayed</hi> in their lives, and know no more what <hi>Prayer</hi> means, than I know the way to <hi>Rome;</hi> but alas, <hi>prayer</hi> doth not lye in theſe things, in ſpeaking good Language, and putting up fine Petitions, if that be all; no, <hi>Prayer</hi> is another thing, it is the breathings of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the hearts of the Saints after God, and to God; many times that ſoul <hi>prayes,</hi> and that excellently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> powerfully, who perhaps is not able to ſpeak a word, or if hee do, hee is not able to ſpeak ten words true ſenſe together, when as another which ſpeaks fluent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and orderly, and that for houres together, perhaps <hi>prayes not</hi> a word all that time.</p>
               <p>Obſerv. 6. <hi>In the laſt dayes there ſhall bee a greater powring forth of the Spirit than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</hi> This I gather from the laſt thing in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the words, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>time when</hi> this ſhall bee, <hi>that day.</hi> — Hence the word <hi>pouring</hi> is much uſed, when the giving of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the laſt dayes is ſpoken of, denoting an <hi>abundant mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> which ſhall at this time bee given forth, for what was formerly, wherein God did as it were <hi>drop</hi> his <hi>Spirit,</hi> now hee <hi>poures</hi> it forth, and the reaſons are becauſe God hath <hi>greater works</hi> to do in the laſt dayes, and the Church <hi>comes nearer</hi> to mans eſtate, and the people of God have <hi>more and greater enemies</hi> to incounter with than in former times they had, and therefore God gives them <hi>more of the Spirit;</hi> what a mercy then is it to be brought forth and to live in the laſt dayes? And how doth it call upon us all, the nearer theſe times draw on, to bee the more <hi>ſpiritual?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:115823:145"/>
               <p>Thus much for the Obſervations from the firſt part of the words, I come now to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; the <hi>effects</hi> of this powring forth of the Spirit, <hi>They ſhall look on him whom they have pierced.</hi> —</p>
               <p>Obſerv. 7. <hi>The ſins of beleevers do pierce Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> This is implied, in that they look upon him whom they have <hi>pierced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerv. 8. <hi>Chriſt muſt bee looked upon as pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by us before wee can mourn.</hi> They do not mourn, nor ſhed a tear till then.</p>
               <p>Obſerv. 9. <hi>When Chriſt is looked upon as pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by us, then wee ſhall mourn.</hi> They look on him, and do mourn.</p>
               <p>Obſerv. 10. <hi>That mourning which ariſeth from the beholding of a pierced Chriſt, is a very bitter and grievous mourning.</hi> And they ſhall mourn for him as one mourneth for his onely Son.</p>
               <p>Obſerv. 11. <hi>None can thus look upon Chriſt, or mourn for him, but only thoſe, upon whom God pours his Spirit.</hi> I will poure out my Spirit — and they ſhall look—and they ſhall mourn.—</p>
               <p>I ſhall wave all theſe, and pitch upon one Obſervation from the latter part of the words, which is this, <hi>viz,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerv. <hi>True Goſpel-humiliation doth ariſe from a looking upon a pierced Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the opening of this point, I ſhall ſhew,</p>
               <p n="1">1 That it <hi>doth not ariſe</hi> from any other thing, and doth from this.</p>
               <p n="2">2 What <hi>manner</hi> of looking upon Jeſus Chriſt that is, which doth beget true mourning, or Goſpel-humiliation.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:115823:145"/>
               <p n="3">3 How this Goſpel-humiliation <hi>is begotten in the ſoul,</hi> from a looking upon Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Of the firſt, That it <hi>doth not ariſe</hi> from any other thing, and <hi>doth</hi> from this.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>It doth not ariſe from nature:</hi> There is a kinde of <hi>humility</hi> in many a man by <hi>nature,</hi> but this is not <hi>Goſpel-humility;</hi> and there is too, a <hi>natural ſorrow,</hi> but this is not <hi>Goſpel-humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This is an herbe that grows not in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> garden; any other <hi>humiliation</hi> ſaving <hi>Goſpel-humiliation</hi> may grow there.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>It doth not ariſe from imitation of others;</hi> the examples of others. Some things which are not <hi>natural,</hi> are done by <hi>imitation,</hi> as an Ape will do many things by <hi>imitation,</hi> which are not <hi>natural;</hi> but this doth ariſe from hence, <hi>ſeeing</hi> another humbled, and <hi>imitating</hi> him.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>It doth not ariſe from a ſenſe or diſcerning of ſin in a man.</hi> Many there are who <hi>ſee</hi> their <hi>ſin,</hi> and will acknowledge the ſame (natural light convincing thereof) and cry out of it, and yet are ſtrangers to <hi>Goſpel-humiliation:</hi> Many a one cryes out of his Drunkenneſs, &amp;c. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves againſt it, I have been ſo and ſo; O but I think I will never do ſo more, I will turn over a new leaf, &amp;c. and yet are not <hi>humbled. Cain ſaw</hi> his <hi>ſin,</hi> and run mad upon it, and <hi>Judas ſaw</hi> it and hanged himſelf, and yet were not <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</hi> So men may ſinne till they runne mad, hang and drowne themſelves, and yet not <hi>humbled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>It doth not ariſe from looking on the Law, and the threats thereof, and preſſing theſe on the ſoul.</hi> Some there are, who hearing of repentance,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115823:146"/>and <hi>Goſpel-humiliation,</hi> would fain get a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and <hi>humiliation</hi> of their own, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they run to the <hi>Law,</hi> and read over and over the <hi>Threats, Curſes,</hi> and <hi>Damnations</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> thinking by this to do the deed, when alas poor ſouls, they do but knock a flint to get water out of it, none comes, and they knock, knock, knock their hearts, and the Law together, to bring forth the water of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and all to no purpoſe, none comes.</p>
               <p n="2">2 What <hi>manner</hi> of looking upon Chriſt is this, that doth beget this Goſpel-humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>It is not a looking upon Chriſt with the outward and bodily eyes.</hi> Thus many ſaw Chriſt when hee was here below; yea, thus they <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held</hi> Chriſt who yet crucified him, and yet this did not beget <hi>Goſpel humiliation</hi> in any that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held</hi> him only thus: And thus likewiſe every one ſhall ſee him when hee comes, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>7. <hi>Behold, hee cometh with clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him, and they alſo which pierced him;</hi> yet wee read not that this ſhall <hi>humble</hi> any, who are not otherwiſe <hi>humbled;</hi> indeed <hi>mens hearts ſhall fail them for fear,</hi> men ſhall bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered, and at their wits end; when the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard and Sabbath-breaker, and hee that comes hither now to ſcoffe and flout and jeer, ſhall ſee Chriſt coming in flaming fire to take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on him, they ſhall bee at their wits end; <hi>mens hearts ſhall faile them,</hi> the Captain, and the ſturdy valiant Souldier which now have hearts like Lions and Tigers, and will not
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115823:146"/>bee ſtartled though they meet with men or Devils, who have lived here prophanely, drinking, and ſwilling; their hearts who never failed them ſhall at this day when they ſhall ſee Chriſt coming to take vengeance on prophane perſons, faile them, and ſhake and quiver with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them like an aſhen leaf, and they ſhall cry to the mountains and rocks to fall on them, &amp;c.— and yet for all this they ſhall bee far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any work of <hi>Goſpel-humiliation</hi> upon them, therefore it is <hi>not looking upon Chriſt with the bodily eyes</hi> doth it.</p>
               <p>But that <hi>looking</hi> upon Chriſt which begets this true <hi>Goſpel-humiliation,</hi> it is <hi>looking upon Chriſt with a ſpiritual eye, an eye of faith,</hi> that is, <hi>looking</hi> upon Jeſus Chriſt not as if he were a man onely like other men, walking here; but as one that God the Father ſent into the world to dye for the fins of poor ſinners; and who, when hee was here did ſuffer death to this end, that hee might take their ſins away; and by dying hee hath waſhed mee, a poor foul filthy ſinner, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mee from all my ſins: When a poor Drunkard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who hath lived like a Swine twenty, thirty, forty years, <hi>lookes</hi> thus upon Chriſt, hee is aſhamed of himſelf, and <hi>mourns bitterly</hi> for his ſins; when hee can ſay, I have been ſuch a vile Drunkard, ſuch a Sot, ſuch a Whoremaſter, as there hath not been ſuch another in the Country, and yet Chriſt dyed for mee, and hath waſhed and cleanſed mee, this <hi>humbles</hi> thoroughly, this begets <hi>Goſpel-humiliation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 But how doth this looking upon Chriſt
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:115823:147"/>as pierced for ſin, <hi>beget this true Goſpel-humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>By clear convincing a man of ſin;</hi> There is nothing in the world which brings ſuch clear and ſtrong convictions of ſin as this doth; the <hi>Law</hi> hath no ſuch <hi>convictions,</hi> as <hi>grace</hi> hath, and <hi>beholding</hi> of Chriſt brings: the <hi>Law,</hi> though it come and tell a ſinner of a thouſand ſins hee is guilty of; here, and here, and here thou haſt failed, at ſuch and ſuch a time thou haſt been drunk, been with thy Queans, yet the <hi>Law</hi> preſently puts a man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>doing,</hi> which being a very <hi>natural</hi> way, the poor ſinner which had a wound quite through but even now, comes and claps a duty or two on, and ſo all is healed up, and the man is as whole as a fiſh, and now hee thinks himſelf no ſinner at all; and therefore obſerve where ever the <hi>Law</hi> is moſt preached and urged, there men are beaten into a road of Civility, and there is no men in the world that bleſs themſelves more, that they are in a good eſtate, and without ſin, than theſe men. But now <hi>looking</hi> upon Chriſt, that doth fully and clearly <hi>convince</hi> a man of ſin; when a poor ſoul <hi>looks</hi> upon a pierced Chriſt, O ſaith the ſoul, what a vile wretch am I, I was drunk at ſuch a time, prophaning the Sabbath at ſuch a time, and ſuffering my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to do it at ſuch a time, and behold, this ſin, I ſee it piercing of Jeſus Chriſt; I was ſleighty, formal in duty, proud, unbeleeving, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt my brother at ſuch a time, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, yonder I behold thoſe very ſins piercing of Chriſt. This <hi>convinceth</hi> the ſoul of all
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115823:147"/>ſins; and it ſo <hi>convinceth,</hi> as the ſoul ſees there is no other way in the world, nor help for it, but to run to Jeſus Chriſt, and to flye to the blood of Chriſt: O ſaith the ſoul, I am ſuch a ſinner, and I ſee there is no help, nor releef in the world for mee, but yonder bleeding Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>By exceedingly aggravating of a mans ſins.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> cannot <hi>aggravate</hi> ſin as <hi>looking</hi> upon a pierced Chriſt will and doth; O this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drouſly <hi>aggravates</hi> ſin.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It ſhews that every ſin I commit, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a <hi>loving Father;</hi> O ſaith the ſoul, thus, and thus have I done againſt God, and behold what a <hi>loving Father</hi> hee is to mee, yonder I behold his Son, his onely begotten Son hanging upon the Croſs, and hee is whipping and wounding of him for what I have done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eauſe otherwiſe I muſt have been whipped and wounded for it to all eternity: O the greatneſs of his love, and O the greatneſs of my rebellion; O that ever I ſhould bee ſuch a wretch, and walk thus as I have done.—</p>
               <p n="2">2 It ſhews that every ſin committed it <hi>wounds Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and goes to the heart of Chriſt.

O (ſaith the ſoule) now I behold that very thing, <hi>viz.</hi> my ſinne, which kept mee from enjoying of a <hi>Crowne</hi> and Kingdome, Chriſt hath taken it away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Crowne</hi> from all Eternity was prepared for mee, and nothing is in the way to keepe mee from poſſeſſing of it, but this, I have been a filthy, ſinfull, and a fooliſh creature, and have both forfeited my <hi>Crowne</hi> to Gods Juſtice, and given the ſame to the Devil: But behold yonder Jeſus Chriſt hath bought this <hi>Crowne</hi> againe for mee, ſatisfying Gods Juſtice, and by force hath taken the ſame

               <p>Reaſon (I meane Carnal reaſon) makes us beleeve that this opens a Floud gate to all licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſſe, and hence the wiſe men of the World lay the prophaneneſſe and lewdneſſe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115823:152"/>of perſons living where the grace of God is preached, upon the back of Gods Free Grace, as if the preaching of that to Sinners were the cauſe why Drunkards, Swearers, Sabbath-breakers live as they doe; and hence they ſay, No wonder Hearers are ſo prophane, when their Teachers have found out ſuch a ſweet and eaſie way to Heaven; but the Holy Ghoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes this opinion of Humane Wiſdome, as ſcandalous to the Grace of God, yea altogether falſe and untrue, and tells us, that there is no ſuch way in the world to curbe ſin, to change the hearts and lives of ſinners, as is this preaching of the Free Grace of God, and therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle having revealed the Grace of God, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſaith, <hi>Theſe things I write that you ſin not;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, if there be any Doctrine in the world will mortifie ſin, keep you from it, it is this that I have written to you, I know no more powerful and efficacious means than this is; and therefore I have written theſe things for this very end and purpoſe, that thoſe ſins which lived and reigned in you formerly, might now hereby be ſlaine and mortified.</p>
               <p>This likewiſe the Apoſtle teacheth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>For ſin ſhall not have dominion over you. for yee are not under the Law, but under Grace;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay? Whilſt you were <hi>under the Law</hi> ſin reigned in you, and were you ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame, ſin would reigne in ſpite of you, but now ſaith he, <hi>you are not under the Law; but under grace,</hi> and therefore ſin ſhall not reigne over you, <hi>Grace</hi> will curb and kill it, though the <hi>Law</hi> could not doe it.</p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:115823:152"/>
               <p>So likewiſe. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>For the grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that denying ungodlineſſe, and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, doe not ſay, becauſe the <hi>Grace</hi> of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and is preached in the world to poor Sinners, therefore men will be prophane, and live in all <hi>ungodlineſſe,</hi> no, no, the <hi>grace</hi> of God teacheth all thoſe who hear and receive the ſame another leſſon, to <hi>deny ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts;</hi> whereas before they were as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Drunkards, Adulterers, &amp;c. now they deny theſe things, and are by hearing and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, become profeſſed enemies to what before they loved. So that you ſee the preaching of <hi>Grace</hi> it is no enemy, but a real friend to <hi>holineſſe</hi> of life and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is ſo farre from giving life thereto, that it quite kills and deſtroyes ſin.</p>
               <p>I ſhall give you a Reaſon or two, why the Grace of God is ſo effectual a means of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of ſin.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Becauſe the Grace of God, it begets a kind of Spiritual ingenuity in the Soul of that ſinner that hears and receives the ſame.</hi> The more <hi>ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> a man hath, he is of the more yeelding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to thoſe things which in themſelves are good, juſt, and honeſt, an <hi>ingenuous</hi> man is more inclinable to be drawne to things which are Naturally, and Morally good than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man is; you may work more upon an <hi>ingenuous</hi> nature with a word, than you can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another with threats, or blowes. Now, <hi>Grace</hi>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:115823:153"/>makes a man <hi>ingenuous,</hi> it firſt puts a Principle of <hi>ingenuity</hi> in him, which being put in hee is now more eaſily led to whatſoever the <hi>Grace</hi> of God commands him, and from whatever the <hi>Grace</hi> of God forbids him. A ſtubborne Childe muſt be cudgelled to doe what his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would have him doe, or avoyd what hee would have him forbear; but an <hi>ingenuous</hi> Childe is led with a word ſpeaking, <hi>Grace</hi> makes a wilde and untamed nature to bee an <hi>ingenuous</hi> pliable nature; and therefore a man being now made <hi>Spiritually ingenuous,</hi> no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth <hi>Grace</hi> ſay to him, goe, but he goes; come, but he comes; doe this, avoyd that, but he doth the one, and avoyds the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Law</hi> doth not put ſuch a Principle of <hi>ingenuity</hi> in a man, and therefore perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame, one day they are threatned, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day they feele the Whip and Rod for their ſins; another while they reſolve; vow, and covenant they will ſin no more, and yet ſtill they goe in the old track, they ſin and vow, and vow and ſin, and all becauſe there is not a <hi>ſpiritual ingenuity</hi> wrought in them, as <hi>Grace</hi> works in all thoſe that hear and receive the ſame; but now <hi>Grace,</hi> that makes a man ſo <hi>ingenuous,</hi> that conſidering what God hath done for poore Sinners, what Chriſt hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to take away ſin, how free and willing God is to receive him, make him a Son and Heir here, give him Heaven and glory hereafter, he would not now lye ſwilling and ſweltering in his old ſins, and luſts, though hee might; the Soul needs not now to vow and covenant a
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:115823:153"/>twelve month together againſt ſuch and ſuch ſins it is addicted unto, no but it hears the voyce of Gods <hi>grace</hi> telling it, what Chriſt hath done for it, how willing God is to pardon all his ſins, and bidding it doe this, avoyd that, and preſently it is made inclinable to obey the voyce of Gods grace; what ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6.1. <hi>Shall we ſin becauſe grave doth abound? no, God forbid;</hi> we have more <hi>ingenuity</hi> in us than to doe thus, becauſe God loves us, and is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to pardon cur ſins here, and to glorifie us hereafter, ſhall we therefore doe what we can to grieve him, to offend and trouble him? no, God forbid, we are more <hi>ingenuous</hi> than ſo: nay, we cannot doe it, our very hearts are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and our ſouls hate and abhorre the thoughts of it; we would not for a world bee found to require the Lord thus. So, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13, 14, 15. <hi>For whether we be beſides our ſelves, it is to God; or whether we be ſober, it is for your Cauſe, for the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we thus judge, that if one dyed for all, then were all dead; and that he dyed for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which dyed for them, and roſe again;</hi> As to ſay, whether we be <hi>mad,</hi> or <hi>ſober,</hi> judge of us as you pleaſe, yet have wee ſo much <hi>ingenuity</hi> as to <hi>judge</hi> thus, that if Jeſus Chriſt <hi>dyed</hi> for us, we ſhould now <hi>live</hi> to him; if he came and purchaſed an <hi>everlaſting life</hi> for us, our <hi>ingenuity</hi> makes us reaſon that it is a fit thing that we ſhould <hi>live</hi> this our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral life to him, and conſecrate it wholly to his ſervice.</p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:115823:154"/>
               <p>What is the reaſon that many a poor Soul ſits all the week long at the Ale-pot, Sweares, and Whores, and yet now and then he vowes and reſolves againſt ſuch courſes, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not for his heart and bloud (as we ſay) leave them, but the <hi>Law</hi> when hee hath done ſuch things whips and ſtings him, and this hardens him; whereas did but ſuch a poor Soul ſee that he is by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt delivered from wrath</hi> to come, freed from the <hi>Law,</hi> Sin and Satan, did but God let him to ſee the hope of his calling, and what a happy and bleſſed eſtate hee is by Chriſt brought into, there would bee ſuch an <hi>ingenuity</hi> wrought within him, that hee needs not vow and covenant to bee Drunk, and Swear, and Whore no more; no, but his heart would abhor to deal ſo baſely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily with a God ſo infinite rich in love, and abounding in <hi>Grace</hi> and mercy towards him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe the grace of God it hath more full, and clear precepts to holineſſe than the Law hath;</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> that hath ten Commands, but the <hi>grace</hi> of God, that hath many hundred Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual commands, wherein it injoynes ſpiritual obedience and newneſs of life; and then the commands of <hi>grace,</hi> they are, as <hi>more,</hi> ſo of a more <hi>ſpiritual nature;</hi> whatſoever the <hi>Law</hi> commands, Natures light teacheth, and a man may by Natures light convince a man of theſe things; but now the precepts of <hi>grace</hi> are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and ſupernatural, ſuch as a Natural man by Natures light cannot perceive. The precepts of <hi>grace</hi> are called, <hi>the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:115823:154"/>l Cor. 2. <hi>Which the Natural man cannot perceive, but they are fooliſhneſſe unto him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Where the <hi>grace</hi> of God is preached and received, there doth the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God goe, who is a <hi>teaching Spirit,</hi> and teacheth the Soul infinite more commands, and with more clearneſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration doth it diſcover truth, than any Natural or Moral man by his Natural light, or ſtudy of the <hi>Law</hi> can ever finde out: the <hi>Law</hi> diſcovers to a man the <hi>outward actions</hi> of ſin, and forbids theſe, but when <hi>grace</hi> comes with its precepts, it makes diſcovery of the <hi>firſt riſings,</hi> motions, ſtirrings, and concupiſcence of theſe things in the Soul, and forbids theſe; and hence by reaſon that the <hi>grace</hi> of God (or the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi> for that I underſtand by the <hi>grace</hi> of God all along) hath more full, higher, and more Spiritual inſtructions than any the <hi>Law</hi> hath, makes further diſcoveries of ſin than the <hi>Law</hi> barely conſidered can doe, it comes to paſſe that it is the moſt effectual means of killing and ſubduing ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Becauſe there is a power in grace for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing and killing of ſin;</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, 2 Cor. 3. that <hi>the Law it is a killing letter,</hi> that is, it is only a <hi>bare letter</hi> without any <hi>power,</hi> bidding us to doe this, and avoyd that, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes <hi>no aſſiſtance</hi> to us, yet tells us, if wee doe not obey it we ſhall be damned; and ſo it is a <hi>killing letter,</hi> that is, to us, it <hi>kills us,</hi> inſtead of killing our ſins; but now the <hi>Goſpel</hi> gives <hi>life,</hi> that doth not only command but giveth <hi>power</hi> to doe, and ſo is a <hi>word of life.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115823:155"/>hee calls the <hi>Law</hi> a <hi>voyce of words</hi> for the ſame reaſon, becauſe it did command and forbid things under the penalty of Death and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and it ſaw the poor Creature to bee weak, and altogether unable to doe either the one or the other, and yet gave him <hi>no power</hi> at all, and ſo was only a terrible <hi>voyce of words</hi> to him. The <hi>Law</hi> (as one ſaith) it doth teach juſt as the Commandements written upon the walls doe, a poor man comes in and reads them over, and yet his heart is never the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, never the more fit to obey any of them becauſe he reads them there; but now the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> on the <hi>grace</hi> of God, that brings <hi>power</hi> along with it; a poor Soul which before lived in ſins, and thought it impoſſible that ever hee ſhould leave them, or have them ſubdued, now findes a <hi>power</hi> within him <hi>killing and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing</hi> thoſe ſins of his; hence it is called, <hi>The power of God unto ſalvation,</hi> Rom. 1.16.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Becauſe a Soul never comes to ſee ſin in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per colours, until the grace of God is diſcovered to it.</hi> Take a poor Soul that is convinced of his ſins by the <hi>Law,</hi> yet doth hee not ſee the foule, filthy, and <hi>odious nature</hi> of his ſins, and how exceedingly every ſin he commits is <hi>aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> and how ſad by reaſon of ſin his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is; as doth another poor Soul, who ſees his ſins, and himſelf a ſinner in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and by the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> A poor Soul that ſees his ſins through the vail of the <hi>Law,</hi> never comes to ſee the <hi>odiouſneſs</hi> of ſin, nor to hate ſin for it ſelf, nor the <hi>aggravations</hi> of his ſin, as doth that Soul which beholds the ſame in the Bloud of
<pb facs="tcp:115823:155"/>Jeſus, in the glaſſe of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> A poor Soul that ſees his ſin by the <hi>Law,</hi> doth not ſee in what a miſerable and <hi>undone condition</hi> hee is in by reaſon of his ſin; hee ſins to day, and hee ſees and knowes it, and knowes too that he hath deſerved thereby eternal death, and perhaps his Conſcience gripes him for it; but to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hee runs to his praying, and vowing, and covenanting, and here hee licks himſelf whole againe, thinks to make God amends by future obedience for former diſobedience; and when he hath been drunk, wanton, uncleane, cheated his Neighbour, &amp;c. preſently he runs to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and confeſſing, and reſolving to change his courſe of life, and doe thus no more, and then hee thinks all is well, and the ſcores are croſſed between God and him. Thus the poor Sinner conceits no danger, but bleſſeth himſelf that hee hath done God no injury, and therefore God means him no ill, and ſo all is well, and he is happy, when alas (poor ſoul) hee is meerly gull'd, hee feedeth on aſhes (as the Prophet ſpeaks) a deceived heart hath turned him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſo that he cannot ſay, Is there not a lye in my right hand.</p>
               <p>Whereas when a poor Soul comes to have the <hi>grace</hi> of God diſcovered to it, or the <hi>Goſpel</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto it, and it embraceth the ſame, it then comes to ſee the <hi>odious and filthy nature</hi> of its ſins, how every ſin peirced Chriſt, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, made him who is bleſſed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to lye under a Curſe; how exceedingly every ſin it commits <hi>aggravated,</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt <hi>grace</hi> and mercy, &amp;c. O then it
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115823:156"/>ſees that there is no way in the world to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from its ſins but by Jeſus Chriſt, no righteouſneſſe will ſtand it in ſtead but Chriſts; whereas before, it thought its praying, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, the works of its owne righteouſneſſe would have ſaved it; now it ſees that all is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſin is of ſo deep a dye that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world will, or can waſh it out, but the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Becauſe there is nothing of a more contrary nature to ſin than the grace of God is;</hi> the beſt way to deſtroy a <hi>contrary,</hi> is to oppoſe its <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to it; if you would put out Fire, throw water upon it; if you would have your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber free from Darkneſſe, open the Window and let in the Light; <hi>contraries</hi> fight and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deſtroy each other, and the more <hi>contrary</hi> things are, the more doe they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to doe it. Now, there are no <hi>greater contraries</hi> than <hi>Sin</hi> and the <hi>Grace</hi> of God are; <hi>Sin</hi> is the <hi>greateſt darkneſſe,</hi> the <hi>grace</hi> of God is the <hi>greateſt light;</hi> and therefore theſe two are in continual fight, and labour to deſtroy each other; in which Combate the <hi>Grace</hi> of God ever prevailes, as the light of the Sun being the greateſt light doth ever expel darkneſſe when ever it comes, let it be ever ſo much. All light is <hi>contrary</hi> in its nature to darkneſſe, yet if the light be but ſmall, and the darkneſſe great, wee ſee in will not expel it. So may I ſay, the <hi>Law</hi> is in its own nature holy, juſt, good, ſpiritual, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to ſin, yet becauſe it is but a little light in compariſon of the <hi>grace</hi> of God, as it were the ſhining of a Candle to the Sun, and ſin being
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115823:156"/>the greateſt darkneſs, it doth not therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome and expel the ſame. And hence the diſcovery of the <hi>grace</hi> of God is the moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual means to kill ſin, becauſe it is of ſuch a <hi>contrary nature</hi> to ſin, that either ſin muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, or it will deſtroy ſin; but ſin never being able to doe the one, it will and doth in all thoſe Souls which hear, and receive the ſame, by degrees doe the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Then ſee <hi>how the grace of God is wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the World, when men cry out, this is your preaching of Free Grace, what comes of it, but to make a company of Hypocrites, to make perſons looſe and prophane;</hi> when indeed this is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falſe, and an abominable ſlander of the <hi>Free Grace</hi> of God; the <hi>grace</hi> of God is the greateſt motive and means to <hi>holineſſe</hi> that is in the World, and if that will not mortifie ſin, to be ſure nothing elſe will doe it. Men may talk of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the terrours thereof, and the thunderings of Hell and Damnation, as the only means to kill ſin; but ſure enough if the <hi>grace</hi> of God will not doe it, theſe never will; it is one thing to have ſin killed, another thing to have it bridled; the <hi>Law</hi> may put a bridle upon a mans ſins and luſts, but it never kills them; but <hi>grace,</hi> that kills ſin. Therefore it is an <hi>injury</hi> offered to the <hi>grace</hi> of God to ſay of it, that it makes men Sinners, it makes them looſe, &amp;c. for it doth the contrary, <hi>Shall we ſin becauſe grace aboundeth, no, God forbid:</hi> Thus <hi>grace</hi> reaſoneth.</p>

                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Then, wouldeſt thou overcome thy ſins? <hi>ſtudy the grace of God more;</hi> the more God
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115823:157"/>lets the light of his <hi>grace</hi> into thy Soule, the more ſhalt thou finde thy ſins to dye. Many poor Soules there are which ſtrive againſt their ſins, and labour to keep up their hearts in waies of obedience, &amp;c. and yet little fruit comes of all their toyl, and ſweat, and tiring themſelves, why, becauſe they weary them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out in a way of <hi>works,</hi> to get that, which is to be obtained only by <hi>grace;</hi> they ſeek after Righteouſneſie, and Juſtification, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and Sanctification, not by faith, not from the <hi>grace</hi> of God, but as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did by the <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and ſo doing, it fares with them as with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they doe not obtaine that which they ſeek for. Poor Souls, you cry out, O my ſins, my ſins, I cannot ſubdue them, ſuch and ſuch a luſt is too hard for me; and what is the cauſe? why this, you think to get the maſtery of your ſins by your <hi>works,</hi> and this wil never doe it.</p>
               <p>Let mee tell you a little the road you go in to mortifie and ſubdue ſin, you finde ſin ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling within you, and overcoming you; well, now ſaith the ſoul, by Gods help, I will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this ſin hereupon thou takeſt up a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to change thy courſe of life, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all occaſions whatſoever that ſhould draw thee to ſin; This reſolution it may be doth not hold, thy ſin maſters thee, and thy reſolution too; but ſayeſt thou, well, yet ſin, I will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thee, then thou falleſt to praying thy ſelfe againſt it, and getteſt others to pray for thee, and runneſt to this Miniſter, and the other, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>readeſt thy caſe before him, and askeſt his
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115823:157"/>advice what thou ſhouldeſt do in it; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, thine own endeavours, or any help they can afford thee, thy ſin is ſtill too ſtrong for thee; well then, When there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way thou knoweſt left, thou falleſt to keeping of Faſts, makeſt vows and covenants, and doeſt as good as ſwear to the Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, that henceforth thou wilt bee as godly as paſſes, and never ſin againſt him more, nor do as thou haſt done, and then it may bee before two dayes, or a week come at an end, thou breakeſt all, and art now in a worſe caſe than ever, and even at thy wits end.</p>
               <p>O poor ſouls, This is the way you go in, to get holineſſe, to have your ſins mortified, and this is the fruit of it, after all your ſtriving and ſtrugling, tugging and pulling to fetch your ſins out by head and ears, they abide there ſtill; and the reaſon is, becauſe you go about it in a way of <hi>working,</hi> whereas you ſhould look for all from <hi>Grace,</hi> and ſo ſtudy the <hi>Grace of God more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sin it is like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> binde them with ever ſo many iron fetters of the <hi>Law,</hi> it will ſnap them all to peeces. Though in ſome theſe fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters chain ſin, which is becauſe ſin is willing to bee chained, that ſo hereby they may bee lulled aſleep in a good opinion of themſelves, and thereby deceive their owne ſouls; yet others whom God out of love will not ſuffer to bee gulled in this manner, finde it otherwiſe, they ſee and know by woful experience, that all theſe fetters are but like ſo many twine threads; bind a Lion with a twine thread, and what doe you,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115823:158"/>you were as good, and better ſit ſtill and doe nothing, for he will but tear and rent you the more: So ſin, by all this, doth but rage the more. The Apoſtle excellently ſets this forth, Rom. 7.8 9, 10, 11. <hi>But ſin taking occaſion by the Commandement, wrought in mee all manner of concupiſcence, for without the Law ſin was dead; For I was alive without the Law once, but when the Commandement came, ſin revived, and I dyed, and the Commandement which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death; for ſin taking occaſion by the Commandement deceived me, and by it ſlew me. Sin taking occaſion</hi>— Sin made an <hi>advantage</hi> of the Commandement to bee more inſolent — <hi>Without the Law ſin was dead</hi> — Sin lay ſtill, and did not ſhew that livelineſſe which was in it, till the Commandement came to reſtraine it, and then it began to beſtir it ſelf, the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have laid bonds upon it, then ſin which lay aſleep, and as it were dead before, gets up; ſaith the Commandement, you ſhall be curbed and bound; nay, but ſaith Sin, I will not be bound; ſaith the Commandement, you ſhall not doe thus; nay, but ſaith Sin, I will doe it, and the more becauſe you ſay I ſhall not.</p>
               <p>Therefore poor Soule, haſt thou been toyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſweating, and tiring thy ſelf with thy Vowes and Covenants one year after another, to maſter thy ſins, and is all hitherto to no purpoſe? then poor Soule take another way, for hitherto thou haſt been out of the way; labour to get a ſight of the <hi>rich grace</hi> of God to poor ſinners, and then thy heart will from a
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115823:158"/>
                  <hi>holy ingenuity</hi> ſay, What, is there ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>grace</hi> in God to poor ſinners, is hee willing to pardon me a poor Sinner, give mee Heaven and make mee bleſſed for ever, and ſhall I bee ſuch a Wretch as to nouriſh ſuch a deadly enemy to him in my boſome, as this my ſin is? O no, no, ile never bee ſo baſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and deal ſo ungratefully with ſo good a God. I tell thee poor Soule, that ſuch conſiderations as theſe are, will more weane thy heart from ſin, and beget a hatred thereof within, then ever all the thunderings or terrors of the <hi>Law</hi> either will or can doe.</p>

The more a Chriſtian falls, the more hee is taught to <hi>live by faith:</hi> When I ſee righteouſneſs in my ſelf, I am prone to reſt too much upon, and to live upon that; but when I can ſee no righteouſneſs at all, but do inſtead thereof, ſee daily, and hourly a great deal of unrighteouſneſs, I am led hereby to live out of my ſelfe upon anothers righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and hereby <hi>faith</hi> is kept in daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>To prevent ſecurity.</hi> The more enemies a man hath about him, and near him, the more <hi>watchful</hi> hee is thereby made.

               <p n="9">9 What wee may <hi>learn hence</hi> as matter of our duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1 What is this <hi>office</hi> of an Advocate?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The word <hi>Advocate</hi> is in Scripture no where uſed but in this place, therefore to finde out what it is, wee muſt look to the firſt <hi>riſe</hi> of it. Now it is a borrowed ſpeech taken from the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> in which thoſe are called <hi>Advocates,</hi> which wee in the <hi>Common Law</hi> call <hi>Councellors.</hi> Now in <hi>Law</hi> the <hi>office</hi> of an <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> is this, to <hi>plead in a way of Juſtice, and from principles of equity and juſtice, anothers cauſe, who is not ſo well able to plead it himſelf.</hi> Chriſts <hi>office</hi> then as an <hi>Advocate</hi> is this, <hi>to plead the cauſes of poor ſinners who cannot themſelves plead them, and that in a way of Juſtice.</hi> Here is the great difference betwixt Chriſts pleading and ours: Whenſoever wee plead, wee plead but as <hi>petitioners,</hi> but when Chriſt pleads hee pleads as an <hi>Advocate. A petitioner</hi> hee brings his cauſe to the foot of mercy, and leaves it there, hee dares not appeal to Juſtice, leſt hee bee caſt; but now an <hi>Advocate</hi> hee pleads in a way of juſtice, hee brings his cauſe to the bar of Juſtice, and is willing it ſhould bee tryed by Juſtice, and ſtand or fall there. When wee come with our cauſes to God, wee muſt as <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners</hi> throw them down at the foot of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſtand to the verdict of mercy; but when Chriſt takes up our cauſes, hee goes bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the bar of Juſtice, and pleads them there, hee makes appeals to Juſtice, and ſaith, Do
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115823:162"/>but ſpeak, O Juſtice, whether it bee not a fit and requiſite thing that this poor ſinner ſhould have the cauſe go of his ſide. I have dyed, ſatisfied for him, purchaſed this, is it not a juſt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual thing that it ſhould go well with the poor ſinner and his cauſe; I will be tried even by thee, O Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="2">2 What <hi>manner of Advocate is Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Hee is an Advocate <hi>in the ſuperior Court.</hi> An <hi>Advocate in the ſuperior Court,</hi> is better than in the <hi>inferior,</hi> becauſe there may bee an appeal from the <hi>inferior,</hi> and a ſentence there paſſed is not determinative, becauſe it may bee reverſed above; but now the <hi>Laws and Decrees of the ſuperior Court,</hi> they are binding and determinative, there can bee no appeale thence, but whatſoever is ratified there, carries the authority and force of a <hi>Law</hi> with it. Now Chriſt is an <hi>Advocate</hi> in the <hi>ſuperior Court,</hi> hee is an <hi>Advocate with the Father,</hi> as in the Text; and ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. it is ſaid that Chriſt is <hi>not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the holy places made with hands, but heaven it ſelfe;</hi> — the High Prieſts under the <hi>Law</hi> when they were to plead (which was a part of their office) they entred into the <hi>holy places made with hands,</hi> they pleaded here <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;</hi> But now Chriſt our High Prieſt and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,</hi> hee is gotten <hi>into heaven it ſelf,</hi> and there hee pleads in Gods preſence, at the <hi>higheſt bar,</hi> hee pleads. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Wee have a great High Prieſt which is paſſed into the Heavens;</hi> Heaven now is the place where Jeſus Chriſt is Prieſting of it, and where Chriſt is pleading with the Father for us. And hence it comes to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:115823:162"/>paſs, that whenſoever Jeſus Chriſt gets any ſentence to bee paſſed for the poor ſinner, it is definitive, there can bee no alteration of it, nor appeal from it, becauſe it is the ſentence of the <hi>higheſt Judicature,</hi> a ſentence paſſed in the <hi>higheſt Court,</hi> which no ſubordinate power can change or alter.</p>
               <p>Hence likewiſe in this reſpect, Jeſus Chriſt is of all other <hi>Advocates</hi> the moſt uſeful, becauſe hee pleads in ſuch a place, where if hee do procure by his mediation an act to bee but once paſſed in the behalf of the poor ſinner, whoſe cauſe hee pleads, there can never bee any repealing of that act, but it remains like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> irreverſible. In our Courts of Law a man may have a ſentence paſſed for him to day, and againſt him to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and one Court repeals what another enacts, yea the Laws and Ordinances of the <hi>ſuperior Courts,</hi> are ſubject to mutation and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration; but now Chriſt pleads as an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> in ſuch a <hi>Court</hi> where every Law is binding for ever, ſentences paſſed are unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; O poor ſinner, if through the mediation of Chriſt, thou haſt an acquittance given thee of all thy ſins and debts thou oweſt God, it is unalterable; If a grant of any favour, it is unalterable; If a right or title to any inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance afterwards to bee injoyed, it is unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: What poor ſinner is there that would not now run to Chriſt as an <hi>Advocate,</hi> for the pardon of his ſins, grace, heaven? &amp;c. which if once granted to him, ſhall bee his ſurely, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably for ever, even for ever.</p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:115823:163"/>
               <p n="2">2 Hee is an Advocate that is <hi>gifted and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for the worke.</hi> Many times a juſt and righteous cauſe ſuffers through the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of him that hath the <hi>mannaging</hi> of it; But now Chriſt is an <hi>able Advocate,</hi> a <hi>gifted Advocate,</hi> one fit for the work. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine Elect in whom my ſoul delighteth: I have put my Spirit upon him; hee ſhall bring forth judgement to the Gentiles: Hee ſhall not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his voyce to bee heard in the ſtreets. A bruiſed reed ſhall hee not breake, and the ſmoaking flax ſhall hee not quench: Hee ſhall bring judgement unto truth. Hee ſhall not faile, nor bee diſcouraged, till he have ſet judgement in the earth.</hi> See how God hath fitted him: God <hi>upholds</hi> him, puts his <hi>Spirit</hi> on him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But there are two things in a more eſpecial manner, which ſpeak his <hi>fitneſs and qualification</hi> as to the work.</p>
               <list>

               <p n="3">3 Hee is an Advocate that <hi>hath a lawfull call to the Bar.</hi> In our Common and Civill Law, there are <hi>degrees</hi> of Lawyers, wee have our <hi>ſtudents</hi> at Law, our <hi>Councellors,</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants,</hi> and ſometimes it ſo falls out, that a <hi>ſtudient</hi> of the Law is better able to plead the Clients cauſe than a <hi>Serjeant;</hi> yet becauſe hee hath not his <hi>degree</hi> upon him, hee is not <hi>called to the Bar,</hi> and ſo being not <hi>called to the Bar,</hi> hee cannot plead. Sometimes perhaps ſuch a one ſtands by, and hee ſees a poor mans cauſe through the weakneſs of him that mannageth it go to the wall, and hee could help him, and would willingly do it, but now becauſe hee hath not a <hi>call to plead at the Bar,</hi> hee may not. Now Jeſus Chriſt is ſuch an <hi>Advocate</hi> which is not only <hi>gifted</hi> and <hi>able,</hi> but hath alſo a <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115823:164"/>call to the Barre</hi> to plead, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5, 6, 10. <hi>And no man taketh this honour unto himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was</hi> Aaron; <hi>ſo alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelf to bee made an High Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him?

               <p n="4">4 He is a <hi>faithful Advocate; Advocates</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men are <hi>unfaithful</hi> oftentimes, the poor Clients cauſe oftentimes periſheth, not ſo much from the <hi>unskilfulneſſe</hi> or <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> as the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe</hi> of him whom hee entruſts it with.

But now Chriſt is ſuch <hi>an Advocate</hi> as hath <hi>Law and Juſtice</hi> for him, they are <hi>both</hi> of his ſide; here the Lawyer (if I may ſo ſpeak) is above the Law, and here it is Law becauſe the Lawyer ſaies it; in others, the Lawyer therefore ſaith it, becauſe it is Law, but here it is Law, becauſe he ſaies it. If you ſhould have a Cauſe upon the trial, and ſhould have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of theſe three things; Firſt, That you have the <hi>ableſt and moſt faithful Counſellor</hi> to mannage your buſineſſe that the whole Kingdome doth afford.

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115823:165"/>the Court</hi> where he pleads on his ſide, being his Father, and therefore Chriſt is befriended; when the Devil ſhall bee commanded ſilence, and have his mouth ſtopt, then Chriſt ſhall have free liberty to ſpeak, and plead his Cauſe.</p>

               <p n="2">2 The Cauſes Chriſt pleads are the <hi>Cauſes of the Elect, theſe whom the Father hath given Chriſt;</hi> now, the <hi>Elect</hi> of God are either ſuch as are for the preſent in their <hi>unregenerate eſtate,</hi> yet in Gods <hi>ſecret Decree</hi> of <hi>election,</hi> or elſe ſuch as are <hi>regenerated;</hi> the <hi>Cauſes of both theſe</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1 He pleads for the <hi>peace, welfare, and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of his Churches, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord anſwered, and ſaid, O Lord of Hoſts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>and on the Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>againſt which thou haſt had indignation theſe threeſcore and ten years.</hi> The Church was at preſent in a low condition, <hi>in the bottome,</hi> as verſ. 8. the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of God did ride the backs of the people of God; Chriſt in this condition pleads for his Church, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. and what hee pleaded for you may perceive by the anſwer he hath, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>And the Lord anſwered the Angel that talked with me with good words, and comfortable words; ſo the Angel that communed with me, ſaid unto me, cry thou, ſaying, Thus ſaith
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115823:166"/>the Lord of Hoſts, I am jealous for</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>and for</hi> Zion <hi>with a great jealouſie; and I am very ſore diſpleaſed with the Heathen that are at eaſe; for I was but a little diſpleaſed, and they helped forward the affliction. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, I am returned to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, my Houſe ſhall be built in it, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, and a line ſhall bee ſtretched forth upon</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>cry yet, ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, my Cities through proſperity ſhall yet bee spread abroad, and the Lord ſhall yet comfort</hi> Sion, <hi>and ſhall yet chuſe</hi> Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He pleads for <hi>the union</hi> of his Saints and Churches, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.21. <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us; that the world may beleeve that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> How ſhould this ſtirre up Saints in divided times to <hi>union!</hi> doth Chriſt plead for <hi>union above,</hi> and ſhall we <hi>wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle below?</hi> Doth he endeavour it with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhall not wee endeavour it with one another?</p>
               <p n="2">2 He pleads for <hi>particular Souls.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3 He pleads that they <hi>might bee delivered</hi> from the evils of the World, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.15. <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the world, but that thou ſhouldeſt keep them from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi>

               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:115823:166"/>
               <p n="4">4 He pleads for <hi>upholding Grace</hi> in tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31, 32. <hi>And the Lord ſaid,</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Simon, <hi>behold, Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as Wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 He pleads for the <hi>Comforter</hi> to bee given to them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. <hi>And I will pray the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hee ſhall give you another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 He pleads for <hi>his continuance</hi> with them, Joh. 14.16. <hi>That hee may abide with you for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 He pleads for their <hi>perſeverance,</hi> Joh. 17.11. <hi>And now I am no more in the world, but theſe are in the world, and I am come to thee holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, keep through thine owne Name thoſe whom thou haſt given mee, that they may bee one as we are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 He pleads for their <hi>Sanctification,</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth, thy Word is truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9 He pleads for their <hi>glorification,</hi> verſ. 24. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 The <hi>manner</hi> of his pleading.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>He preſents the perſons of his Saints before his Father;</hi> ſaith Chriſt, ſuch a thing I plead for, and behold here is the <hi>Perſon,</hi> ſee what hee is, in how near relation to me; they are thoſe that thou haſt given me, they are mine, and they are thine; ſee Lord, they are no other I ſpeak for.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Hee preſents all the wants of his Saints;</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:115823:167"/>he ſpreads theſe before God, Lord, they want preſerving grace, perſevering, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. —</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>He preſents his owne merits and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe before his Father;</hi> Lord, ſaith Chriſt, is there no righteouſneſs in this poor ſinner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here is righteouſneſs; Doth thy Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſatisfaction, behold here it is. <hi>I have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified thee,</hi> it may bee Lord theſe ſin, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour thee, but <hi>I have glorified thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Hee mannageth their cauſe as his own, in his own Name.</hi> Hee takes up their cauſe and ſaith, Lord, their cauſe is my cauſe; it is the cauſe I am ingaged in, and have dyed for, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.10. <hi>I am glorified in them,</hi> as to ſay, Lord, if it were onely for them, indeed thou mighteſt deny mee, but their cauſe is my cauſe; their cauſe and mine, their glory and mine, is linked together.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Hee uſeth arguments with the Father;</hi> hee doth not barely plead, but <hi>uſeth arguments.</hi> What arguments in <hi>John</hi> 17. (the pattern of Chriſts Interceſſion in heaven) doth Chriſt uſe with his Father, verſ. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, &amp;c. Hee anſwers all the Objections that Satan brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt poor ſouls. See <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>And hee ſhewed mee Joſhua the high Prieſt ſtanding before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan ſtanding at his right hand to reſiſt him. And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord that hath choſen Jeruſalem, rebuke thee, is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Hee uſeth authority in pleading,</hi> Joh. 17.14. <hi>Father I will</hi> — hee layes a kinde of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:115823:167"/>command (as I may ſay) upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hee leaves his petitions as his <hi>will</hi> which muſt bee fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The <hi>Prevalency</hi> of Chriſts Interceſſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>The perſon pleading is a great perſon,</hi> Heb. 4.14. <hi>a great High Prieſt,</hi>— and that in a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold reſpect. Firſt, great <hi>indignity,</hi> ſuch will bee heard, hee is <hi>King of Kings.</hi> Secondly, great <hi>in power,</hi> and ſo able to give whatſoever hee pleads for, and therefore undoubtedly will not let his prayers bee loſt. <hi>All power is given to mee. So Joh.</hi> 14.13, 14. <hi>And whatſoever yee ſhall aske in my Name, that will I do, that the Father may bee glorified in the Son. If yee ſhall aske any thing in my Name, I will do it.</hi> If anything in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or in earth bee uſeful for Saints, hee can command all. Thirdly, great <hi>in favour</hi> with God; long acquaintance makes perſons great in favour, Chriſt was from eternity brought up with the Father; near relation makes perſons great in favour, and Chriſt is the onely childe of God. A man that is great in favour will prevail when another cannot.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>The perſon hee pleads with, is his Father;</hi> Hee is Gods Son, his onely Son, the pleading of a Son is very <hi>prevalent</hi> with his Father. This the Apoſtle makes uſe of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Seeing then that wee have a great High Prieſt that is paſſed into the heavens, Jeſus the Son of God, let us hold faſt our profeſſion.</hi> Yea hee is ſuch a Son as was ever obedient to his Father, and hee pleads this his obedience; Had you a childe that never angred you, and hee ſhould come and ſay, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I never angered you, I pray do not deny
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:115823:168"/>mee ſuch a requeſt, could you deny him? when all the ſervants in the houſe cannot procure ſuch a thing to bee done, the Son doth but come and ſay, Pray Father let it bee done, and it is done. Jeſus Chriſt cannot but <hi>prevail,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>his Father</hi> hee pleads with.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>The cauſe hee pleads, is a cauſe of Juſtice.</hi> Many times when a great perſon, or one in near relation to the Judge pleads, though his cauſe bee unjuſt, yet hee carries it; what then, will Chriſts pleading do, who is ſo great, in ſo near relation to the Judge, and hath a <hi>juſt cauſe</hi> too, think you? Will not hee <hi>prevail?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>The perſon hee pleads with is our Father,</hi> which further ſhews the <hi>prevalency</hi> of Chriſts Interceſſion. If a Father have a childe hee loves dearly, a little intreating will make him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do any thing for his good: But now if another dearly beloved Son ſhould come and plead for this childe with his father, and the childes Father too, how <hi>prevalent</hi> would that plea bee?</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>God hath appointed him this as his office, to plead.</hi> Hee is an <hi>Advocate</hi> called by God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>And no man taketh this honour unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but hee that is called of God, as was Aaron. So alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelf, to bee made an high Prieſt</hi> Pſal. 2. <hi>Ask of me</hi>—God would never have <hi>put</hi> Chriſt into this <hi>office,</hi> were hee not willing to bee <hi>prevailed</hi> with; whenſoever Chriſt pleads, God remembers that hee <hi>put</hi> Chriſt into this <hi>office,</hi> and this makes his plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very <hi>prevalent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>God is as willing to give thoſe things hee
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:115823:168"/>pleads for, as hee is to plead for them.</hi> If a man bee but <hi>willing</hi> to give, there needs not much argument to prevail; ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.26, 27. <hi>I ſay not I will pray the Father for you, for the Father himſelf loveth you;</hi> as to ſay, I do not ſay that you ſhall have all meerly becauſe <hi>I pray,</hi> as if the Father were unwilling, and my praying made him willing; no, nor ſo, <hi>The Father himſelf loveth you,</hi> and is <hi>willing</hi> to give you mercy, though I pray not, as to ſay, I need not to pray for any want of love that is in the Fathers heart to you, or willingneſs to give mercy, if that were all, I need never pray: How willing then muſt hee needs bee when I pray?</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Why</hi> Chriſt is a Saints Advocate.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe it is a part of his office, viz.</hi> his Prieſtly office, and Chriſt will not have any of his Offices lye vacant.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe it is much for Chriſts honour,</hi> that the whole work of our ſalvation from firſt to laſt, ſhould bee ſo mannaged, as that hee ſhould ſtill have a hand in it, and every part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p n="8">8 How this makes for our <hi>ſupport and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> againſt, and under all our ſinnes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In theſe three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 By Chriſts Advocateſhip, <hi>God the Father is put in continual remembrance</hi> of that full and ſatisfactory ſacrifice which was once offered for ſin.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former verſes the Apoſtle <hi>diſcovers</hi> and <hi>condemns</hi> the <hi>evil practices</hi> and <hi>opinions</hi> of ſundry falſe reachers crept in amongſt the Churches in his dayes. In this, hee <hi>warnes Timothy</hi> (and in him all Chriſtians, for the words are not ſpoken to <hi>Timothy</hi> as a Miniſter onely, but alſo as a Chriſtian, it being the duty of all Chriſtians, though of thoſe in ſuch

               <p>I ſhall ſpeak only of the latter part of the words, and of them only as they are a <hi>direction</hi> (though more is in them) given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and all beleevers, how they may <hi>eſcape</hi> the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Evills</hi> of falſe teachers. <hi>Follow after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>—</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>The only and ſpecial way for a Saint to be delivered from the Errors, and Evills of the Times hee lives in, is, to have his heart as much as may bee taken up with, and his ſpirit exerciſed about high and ſpiritual things.</hi> I ſhall prove this point from</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. Where the Apoſtle having fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the <hi>dangerous errors</hi> of the latter times, verſ. 1.2, 3. preſently mindes <hi>Timothy</hi> of <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things,</hi> as the onely preſervatives againſt diſtempers of this nature. Verſ. 7. and 12. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thy ſelf rather unto godlineſs. Bee thou an

               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22. <hi>But follow righteouſneſſe, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</hi> Having certified <hi>Timothy</hi> of the <hi>dangerous errors,</hi> and fearful miſcarriage of <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> hee ſtraightway gives him in charge to minde <hi>ſpiritual things;</hi> as if hee had ſaid, Had <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> laid aſide their vain bablings, and minded theſe things more, they would never have miſcarried as they have done.</p>
               <p>So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. Having foretold of thoſe <hi>peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous times</hi> which ſhould bee in the laſt dayes, verſ. 1, 2.—and given <hi>Timothy</hi> to underſtand that ſome there were already abroad, whoſe temper and manners were like them, which in after times ſhould ariſe, yerſ. 6, 8. hee preſently mindes him of the <hi>ſpiritualneſſe</hi> of his own converſation, as a pattern for him to imitate, verſ. 10. ſtirring him up thereto, verſ. 14. <hi>But continue thou in the things which thou haſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and haſt been aſſured of, knowing of whom thou haſt learned them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So alſo to <hi>Titus,</hi> having in Chap. 1. marked out, and warned <hi>Titus</hi> of a <hi>dangerous</hi> ſort of men, verſ. 10. and 16. In the two next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hee puts <hi>Titus</hi> on to minde and follow <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and practical matters, But ſpeake thou the words which become ſound doctrine,</hi> Chap. 2. verſ. 1. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. When there were <hi>contentions</hi> in the Church, about obſerving dayes and eating meats, hee labours to withdraw them
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115823:172"/>from queſtions of this nature, to the minding and attending of things more <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> as not to offend their weak brethren, verſ. 13. and to minde <hi>righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> verſ. 17.</p>
               <p>So when there was <hi>ſtrife</hi> in the Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> about Circumciſion and legal Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, ſome being brought to beleeve and practice theſe things, the Apoſtle recalls them to <hi>ſpirituals,</hi> Chap. 5.6. and Chap. 6.15. tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that in Chriſt, or in the dayes of the Goſpel, theſe were not the things to bee mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the <hi>new creature, and faith which worketh by love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. When many were drawn to ſtrange and ſottiſh <hi>errors and practices,</hi> that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (who were yet pure) might not bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed and led a way, as hee ſaith, verſ. 4. hee calls them to minde <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> verſ. 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. telling them that the onely cauſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers miſcarriage, was the neglect of theſe, verſ. 19.</p>
               <p>Yet farther, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9. The Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving admoniſhed beleevers to beware of <hi>errors and ſtrange doctrines,</hi> hee gives them this rule for a preſervative, to labour that their hearts might bee <hi>eſtabliſhed with grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To end, in <hi>Jude</hi> 20.21. The Holy Ghoſt having deciphered in the former verſes the falſe Apoſtles, and given them their doom, hee exhorts to this very duty, as the beſt remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch <hi>evils. But yee beloved, building up your ſelves, on your moſt holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep your ſelves in the love of God,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:115823:172"/>looking for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Christ unto eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which Scripture allegations (wherein I have been more large than is uſual, by reaſon of the uſefulneſs of this truth, and ſutableneſs thereof to theſe times) argue the truth of the Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the onely and ſpecial way for a Saint to bee delivered from the Errors and Evils of the Times hee lives in, is, to have his heart as much as may bee taken up with, and his ſpirit exerciſed about, high and ſpiritual things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the further carrying on of this I ſhall handle two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 What I mean by <hi>ſpiritual things.</hi>

               </list>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, By <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> I underſtand <hi>ſuch things</hi> as either tend to the <hi>glory of God,</hi> the <hi>edifying my brother,</hi> the <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſouls,</hi> the <hi>begetting and increaſing of my own peace,</hi> the <hi>mortifying of ſin</hi> in mee, the <hi>quickning of grace, &amp;c. Such things</hi> as theſe I call <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and all principles and practices whatſoever which produce theſe, or ſuch like effects, I may terme <hi>ſpiritual</hi> truths, and <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> works: And on the other ſide, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>opinion</hi> or <hi>practice</hi> it is, which doth not produce <hi>ſuch like effects,</hi> but the <hi>contrary,</hi> I may juſtly exclude from the name of <hi>Spiritual.</hi> Thus you have a general notion of what I mean by <hi>ſpiritual things;</hi> but now for our helpe in the exerciſing of our hearts about <hi>ſpiritual
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:115823:173"/>things,</hi> it is very needful that wee have yet a more diſtinct and particular knowledge of thoſe <hi>ſpiritual things</hi> our hearts ſhould bee <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed</hi> about, which things though they are many more than I am able to ſpeak of, or if I were, have time to do it, yet for the helpe of thoſe who for want of matter, are at a loſſe what to <hi>exerciſe</hi> their hearts about, and ſo uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally take that which comes next to hand, which oftentimes turns to their undoing; I ſhall therefore, having a large field before mee, glean together ſome few handfuls of <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> which may ſerve for matter for us to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe</hi> our hearts about.</p>
               <p>As to begin with <hi>that in finite eternal, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible love of God to poor ſinners;</hi> how free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God <hi>loved</hi> them, when as yet there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>lovely</hi> in them, yea how this <hi>love</hi> was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them from all <hi>eternity,</hi> and continues to <hi>eternity</hi> again: And alſo how <hi>fruitful</hi> this <hi>love</hi> and grace of God towards them hath been, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, as in <hi>electing</hi> and <hi>chooſing</hi> them in his Son Chriſt, from all <hi>eternity,</hi> to bee veſſels of glory, and heires of ſalvation, who naturally were of that very lump whereof many become veſſels of diſhonour, and heirs of damnation; ſo alſo in the fulneſs of time in ſending his onely begotten and beloved Son, who was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained to bee a Prince and a Saviour, out of his own boſome into the world, there by him to accompliſh his own eternal decree concerning the ſalvation of his Elect. This is a thing our hearts ſhould bee much taken up with, and our thoughts exerciſed about.</p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:115823:173"/>
               <p>Again, <hi>How that this Jeſus Chriſt the onely begotten of the Father, being ſent into the world, did willingly part with for a time, all the glory that hee was right heire unto, and poſſeſſor of above, and took upon him</hi> (that ſo hee might accompliſh the work of our redemption) <hi>our nature,</hi> being made man, and born of the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, ſo exceedingly honouring humane nature, far above the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (which hee took not) by uniting it to the Divine.</p>
               <p>Again (which our hearts ſhould bee much exerciſed about) <hi>how that together with this our nature, hee tooke upon him the infirmities and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries thereof,</hi> being poor, hungry, made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, perſecuted, and tempted, &amp;c. that hee might bee in all things like unto his brethren, and bee made a merciful, and faithful High Prieſt, and ſuch a one as might bee touched with a feeling of our infirmities, and might ſympathize with us, in, and under them all; and how that after hee had finiſhed all things which were to bee done by him for our good, <hi>hee laſt of all offered up himſelf a ſacrifice for us,</hi> bearing our ſins in his own body on the Tree, together with all the wrath of his Father due to us for all our ſins, whereby pouring out his ſoul unto death, and making it an offering for ſin, hee gave full ſatisfaction to his Fathers Juſtice for the tranſgreſſion of his people, whom by his death hee delivered from wrath to come, blotting out the hand-writing that was againſt them, and contrary to them, taking it out of the way, and by this one offering,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:115823:174"/>perfecting for ever all them that were ſanctified, or ſet apart by the Father.</p>
               <p>Again farther, <hi>How that having dyed for our ſins, he is riſen again for our juſtification,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf to have gotten the day of the Law, Sin, Hell, and the Devil, &amp; all the enemies of our ſalvation; and likewiſe alluring us hereby that wee are already in him acquited, God having forgiven us all our treſpaſſes, and ſhall aſſuredly one day riſe (as hee is riſen) to live with him in glory hereafter, when this our corruptible ſhall put on incorruption, and this our mortall ſhall put on immortality, and death ſhall bee ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up into victory.</p>
               <p>Again (which our hearts ſhould bee much taken up with) <hi>How that Jeſus Chriſt being now riſen, hee as the common perſon of the Saints, and as a glorious Conqueror is aſcended up into heaven,</hi> herein triumphing over Principalities and Powers, which he by his death had ſpoyled, making a ſhew of them openly, and leading cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity captive? where being arrived, hee is ſate down at the right hand of the Father, upon the Throne of Majeſty in the heavens, having An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Principalities and Powers made ſubject unto him, and all his enemies under his feet, himſelfe being inveſted with Majeſty and Glory, Sovereignty and Power, Authority and Judgement, all which hee improves for the good of his Saints.</p>
               <p>Again farther, <hi>How that the Saints as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in him their common perſon, are quickned together with him, and raiſed up together, and made to ſit together in heavenly places,</hi> being
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:115823:174"/>ſharers and partakers with him in his life and death, in his humiliation and exaltation, hee perſonating them in both, having his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, righteouſneſs, riches, holineſs, made over to them; ſo that they are compleat in him, and of his fulneſſe doe receive grace for grace.</p>
               <p>Again yet farther, how that Jeſus Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in the heavens, <hi>is there imployed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king preparation, and providing manſions for his Saints againſt they come thither;</hi> and is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ready to, and buſied in preſenting the wants and petitions of his people to his Father; hee alſo himſelfe in all our exigencies, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all our infirmities making interceſſion for us; ſo that wee are for ever ſafe and ſecure from all fear and danger, hee ever living to make interceſſion for us: From whence, when all his Elect of Jew and Gentile ſhall bee called home, hee ſhall gloriouſly come attended with his mighty Angels, and ten thouſands of his Saints; when as the Spouſe being arraied in fine linnen, clean and white, hee ſhall take her to himſelfe, and celebrate his glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and having done juſtice upon all her enemies here below, and judged quick and dead, ſhall triumphantly carry her with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into his Fathers Kingdome, where ſhee ſhall for ever bee with him where hee is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the glory the Father hath given him, and injoying with him fulneſſe of glory, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of joy and pleaſures for evermore.</p>
               <p>Again yet farther (the thoughts whereof our thoughts ſhould bee exerciſed about) <hi>how
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115823:175"/>that in the mean time, that his people might bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and made meet to bee partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light, hee hath, and continually doth ſend forth his Spirit</hi> (the great promiſe of the Father) together with Meſſengers and Ambaſſadors having the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel in their mouths, whereby thoſe which everlaſting love did in the beginning chooſe out of the world, and predeſtinated to the adoption of Sons, are in time through grace called, and actually, and perſonally having precious faith given unto them, juſtified from all their iniquities, united to him, made chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, heires of God, and joynt heires with Chriſt, ſanctified by the Spirit, and through the applying of the blood of Jeſus, have their conſciences purged from dead works to ſerve the ever living and true God, daily going on from faith to faith, and ſtrength to ſtrength, till in the end they attaine the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead, and come to behold God in Sion.</p>
               <p>Finally, ſeeing and conſidering what glorious things are, through grace, wrought and prepared for us, and which are in part, and ſhall be in Gods time fully given to us, it ſhould bee the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual exerciſe of our hearts, and that which wee ſhould bee much taken up with, <hi>how wee may come to attain, and enjoy theſe things, ſo as may make for the glory of God, the good of others, and our own comfort more:</hi> It ſhould bee our continual querying, O how ſhall I come to know more of Chriſt, more of the love of God in Chriſt? How ſhall I come to beleeve
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115823:175"/>in Chriſt more, to live by faith more, to injoy the fruit, and comfort of my election through grace, my redemption, juſtification by Chriſt, adoption in him, union with him, more? How ſhall I come to bee more ſanctified by the Spirit, made more conformable to him, have. more of his Image imprinted upon mee, feel him more in his Death and Reſurrection have more fellowſhip with him in his ſufferings? O how ſhall I come to have corruption in mee daily more mortified, my pride mortified, my unbeleefe mortified, my corrupt affections and paſſions mortified, my luke-warmneſs, earthly-mindedneſs, deadneſs, formality in duty mortified? How ſhall I come to have my graces more quickned, my faith, love, godly-ſorrow, humility, ſelf-denial, patience, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, contentedneſs. quickned? O how ſhall I have a heart carried out more to glorifie God in the place, calling I am in, time, oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities I have? How ſhall I have a frame of heart to go about the ſervice of God more freely, willingly, cheerfully, and to act in it more purely, ſincerely every day than other? Such things and queſtions as theſe are, I call <hi>Spiritual things,</hi> and they are the things our hearts ſhould bee <hi>exerciſed</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout?</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Muſt a Saint onely bee exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Spiritual things, are there not ſome external things which a Saint muſt exerciſe himſelfe, in, and about?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>Yes, there are outward Civil imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which a Saint as a man, is with moderation
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:115823:176"/>to bee exerciſed about:</hi> And alſo there are <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinances</hi> and <hi>inſtitutions</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, which a Saint as hee is a Chriſtian, out of obedience to his Maſters command, ſo far as the ſame is made clear to him, is to bee <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed</hi> in, and about; in <hi>exerciſing</hi> himſelfe in which, though the things themſelves are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi> yet hee injoyes much inward and <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> communion with Jeſus Chriſt, therefore I do not oppoſe <hi>ſpiritual things</hi> to all <hi>things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi> neither would I bee ſo underſtood: For though the Kingdome of God doth not conſiſt in meat and drink, yet meat and drink are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their place, and men in an ordinary way cannot live without it. But now when I ſpeak of a <hi>Saints exerciſing himſelf in ſpirituals,</hi> I op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>ſpiritual,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>To things expreſly forbidden,</hi> which are ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in themſelves evill and ſinful, being things not convenient, nor becoming Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.3, 4. <hi>But fornication, and all uncleanneſs, or covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, let it not bee once named amongſt you, as becometh Saints, neither filthineſs, nor fooliſh talking, nor jeſting, which are not convenient.</hi> Prophane courſes become no man, but worſt of all a Saint.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>To things light and frivolous.</hi> Things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed unworthy the thoughts of a Saint, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him: Such things, as though a man ſhould attain what hee aimes at, and would have in them, yet are not worth the breath or wind which is ſpent in ſpeaking of them, or the time lent for the ſtudy of them; things better ſuiting with Infants in grace, who muſt
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:115823:176"/>have their toyes and rattles to play with, though nothing come of it, than thoſe that are men grown, and of age. Such as are ten hundred empty queſtions both in natural and divine things, which the former times have been, and the preſent age is fruitfull in; many of which ſhould I name, the ridiculouſneſs of them would bee an anſwer to them. Things that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world is gained by, but an airy head, and an empty heart; and therefore I call them <hi>light and frivolous;</hi> Things indeed below and unworthy a heart, that hath ſo many precious <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> as would take up his time ſhould hee live twice <hi>Methuſelahs</hi> age to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe</hi> himſelfe about, as hath every Saint, and Son of God; and ſuch variety too of theſe both for pleaſure and delight, as that hee needs not for recreation-ſake to have recourſe unto the other: Yea, things, which though they had no other evill attending of them, yet this they have, <hi>I converſe in old Adam,</hi> and <hi>walke after the fleſh,</hi> whenſoever I meddle with them (as were it not out of my way, I could demonſtrate at large) now this wee know, that it is the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> of a Saint or Son of God, to walk <hi>not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, but after the Spirit;</hi> and this wee likewiſe know, that ſo far as wee <hi>converſe in old Adam,</hi> ſo far wee bring our ſelves under the <hi>curſe,</hi> there being ſince the fall a <hi>curſe</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt all of <hi>old Adam,</hi> whether good or evill; ſo that as his evill deſtroyes us, ſo his good cannot help us; yea his good by labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it in the way of old <hi>Adam,</hi> that is, by our own ſtrength and wiſdome, and not in the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:115823:177"/>way of the new <hi>Adam;</hi> that is, by the ſtrength and wiſdome of the Spirit, becomes evil unto us, and is abominable unto God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>To things dark and doubtful;</hi> ſuch things about Religion (I meane the Circumſtantials thereof) as are not, neither can bee found to be clearly determined, ſo as to give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the diligent and rational Inquiſitor from Scripture; which things, that ſome ſuch things there are, I know none but acknowledge.</p>
               <p>Now about theſe there is verily a fault, when men have their hearts exerciſed day and night in making enquiry after them, as if time and reaſon were given them to bee wholly ſpent in ſearching after that, which it may bee God would not have them know, and which would make nothing for their <hi>ſpiritual advantage</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known; it cannot but be a great evil, when God hath left us ſo many things clear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that we ſhould run out ſo much of our precious time and ſtrength, as many doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>dark and doubtful things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But may ſome ſay, what, will you deny all study of theſe things, may not I ſtudy them, at leaſt to get ſatisfaction if it may bee had concerning them; or in caſe there be any truth in them, if poſſible to find it out?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny not but thou mayeſt ſtudy theſe things, ſo it bee done with theſe Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>That thou beeſt moderate in thy time about ſtudying of them;</hi> allot as <hi>little time</hi> as may bee (though ſome thou doſt) to ſuch things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering alwaies that <hi>thy time</hi> is given thee for
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:115823:177"/>other work, for greater employments, wherein thou mayeſt bee more uſeful for the glory of God, the end of thy Creation, and more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to thy preſent Generation, and more further thine owne peace, and the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch as belong to thee, than ever thou canſt, or art like to doe in following theſe things.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Take heed thy heart be not ſo taken up with theſe things as to neglect greater, and more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things.</hi> It is a thing very ordinarily found amongſt Chriſtians, that they loſe a great deal of their <hi>ſpiritualneſſe</hi> by over-much medling, and exerciſing themſelves in things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo many queſtions about doubtful things (this Circumſtance, and the other) croud in, that the maine <hi>ſpiritual things</hi> are thruſt out, there is no roome for them in the ſoul. And truly this is a very ſad and ſpreading evil in our dayes, wherein things queſtionable are altogether in credit and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme, and things unqueſtionable are laid by, and out of date; we more talk of thoſe things wherein wee differ from others, than of thoſe wherein wee agree, though the one bee but a trifle, and the other matter of greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and here is all the fruit that comes of it, which every one of us if our trading lye this way, ſhall by woful experience finde, wee loſe our <hi>ſpiritualneſſe</hi> by ſo doing.</p>
               <p>I am of the mind of that godly man, (Mr. <hi>Cradock</hi> in his <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> Serm. 1.) who takes this to bee one reaſon why Chriſt hath left many things about his Worſhip in the New
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:115823:178"/>Teſtament ſo dark and doubtful, whereas every thing to a tittle, the ſnuffe of a Candle, and Ilet-hole was clearly determined in the dayes of the Old Teſtament, becauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of God in the New Teſtament was to bring his Saints to be <hi>more ſpiritual;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he hath left them (clear) fewer exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Lawes by farre than they had in their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; ſo thoſe he hath left are of a more <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> nature than theirs were. Chriſt was as faithfull in his houſe as <hi>Moſes</hi> in his, and hee could have made us hundreds of little Laws about external things, and tied us up to Punctil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio's as <hi>Moſes</hi> did his Diſciples, yea would have done it, had this been the only or great matter wherein he was to have been faithful; but Chriſt had another deſigne in the New Teſtament, <hi>viz.</hi> to bring his Saints to bee <hi>more ſpiritual,</hi> and therefore though hee gives us Lawes and Rules for outward worſhip ſo farre as concerns the ſubſtance, yet he is not ſo exact and punctual in laying down Rules touching every Circumſtance as <hi>Moſes</hi> was.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Take heed thou make not an agreement, or diſagreement in things of this nature, the ground of thy love to Saints, or a rule to judge of Saints by.</hi> It is an evil too common among men to take up ſome one circumſtantial Point, and (when they have done) put ſo much ſtreſſe upon it, that they will hardly love any, or owne them for Saints which doe not preſently cloſe with them in it, or which ſeeme but to oppoſe this their opinion, though ever ſo ſound, ſolid, and gracious otherwiſe. Wilt thou ſtudy
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:115823:178"/>theſe things? labour then to have, and keep thy heart in ſuch a frame, as that thou mayeſt dearly love a Saint, and owne the grace of God in him, though hee ſhould altogether, and alwaies ſtand off from thee in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Take heed of making thy owne faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions in things of this nature, binding to others Conſciences;</hi> This is an evil ſomething worſe than the former, when men doe not only ſtudy Niceties, and make Lawes for themſelves, but when they have ſo done, will make Lawes for their Brethren, — and binde their Conſciences to thoſe Lawes which they themſelves have made. Now, wilt thou <hi>exerciſe</hi> thy ſelf in things of this nature, take heed then thou make not thy Conſcience the rule of thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, neither make Lawes over him in ſuch things as thou canſt not aſſure his Conſcience Chriſt hath made them; I had rather yeeld in a hundred things of this nature to a Brothers weakneſſe, than by an abſolute Law of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to be bound up to one.</p>
               <p>Let Saints therefore be wary of tying their Brethren hand and foot in ſuch things wherein Chriſt hath left them free, for Saints if tied, will not doe that, which if they were left to their liberty, they ought to doe, as I remember <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſaith to the Papiſts about eating their meats, and obſerving their dayes; leave us, ſaith he, to our liberty, wee will cat your meats, obſerve your dayes, but bind us hereto, and wee will doe neither.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And laſtly, <hi>Take heed thy ſpirit grow not
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:115823:179"/>hence by degrees to an affectation of novelty, or new things.</hi> Many there are, who firſt take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to pry into <hi>dark and curious queſtions,</hi> and when they have gone on thus a while, there is nothing will pleaſe them but <hi>new things,</hi> and <hi>curious things,</hi> they grow out of love with <hi>old truth,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual heart</hi> matters, theſe are fet by, and it muſt bee ſome <hi>fine new tickling queſtion,</hi> that is fit matter only for their thoughts and meditations; and as for all things elſe, they account them but <hi>low things,</hi> and thoſe that hold them and preſs them, men of <hi>lower light,</hi> and of a <hi>lower forme,</hi> as they ſay. I am almoſt confident of if, that moſt of the <hi>errours</hi> this day broached, or on foot in <hi>England,</hi> or elſewhere, doe grow out of this root, viz. <hi>A neglect of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing the heart about ſpiritual things, and a deſire to be alwaies prying into dark things,</hi> from whence, by degrees there creepes into the Soul a love of <hi>novelty</hi> and <hi>new matters,</hi> which no ſooner is in any, but the heart is as prone and apt to ſuck in <hi>errour,</hi> as a ſpunge water, and of all ſpirits in ſearching after truth, I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Lord to keep me from this, a ſpirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting it ſelf in, and affecting <hi>novelty,</hi> and <hi>new things.</hi>
               </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>That the only and ſpecial way for a Saint to bee delivered from the errours and evils of the times he lives in, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to have his heart as much as may be taken up with, and his ſpirit exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout high and Spiritual things.</hi>

                  <p>I proved it then unto you, and alſo ſhewed you what I did <hi>meane</hi> by <hi>Spiritual things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I now proceed to the <hi>Reaſons,</hi> why the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing the heart about Spiritual things is ſuch a preſervative againſt the errours and evils of the times we live in.</p>
                  <p>Reaſ. 1. <hi>Becauſe ſuch a heart as is exerciſed about Spiritual things findes not leaſure to run out after thoſe poor low things which others trifle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their time, and loſe themſelves about.</hi> Many there are in the world of whom it may be ſaid, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> once ſaid of the <hi>Iſraelites, Yee are idle, yee are idle;</hi> who are very Idlers, and doe nothing at all in <hi>Spirituals,</hi> by reaſon whereof their <hi>hearts</hi> have a great deale of <hi>leiſure,</hi> which becauſe they would be doing and finde nothing to take too, they buſie themſelves juſt as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Boyes doe when they are <hi>idle,</hi> about this toy and the other, ſuch a querk and ſuch a query their time and thoughts are buſied about, and they are continually fancying and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting new Notions, and Chymaera's, and this bears the Bell, and is all in requeſt to day, and this to morrow, and thus they ſtrangely loſe themſelves, running from one fancy unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, till in the end they have out-run Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Religion, and all.</p>
                  <p>Whereas now a Saint which hath his <hi>heart exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed about ſpiritual things</hi> is like a man which is in great dealings and trading, which hath many weighty affairs under his hand together, and is by reaſon hereof ſo full of employment, that he cannot finde time to beat his braines about this
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:115823:180"/>querk, and the other query, all the time that he hath is little enough, and too little, to follow, ſo as that he may not be a looſer of his greater employments, hee findes that had hee two dayes whereas he hath but one, time would be too little for him to buſie himſelf how hee might enjoy more communion with God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand more of the great Myſteries of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, get his heart more mortified, his graces more quickned, &amp;c. though hee ſhould allow other things no time at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">Becauſe <hi>to a heart that is exerciſed about ſpiritual things, other things are dry and empty;</hi> ſuch a <hi>heart</hi> neither findes <hi>reliſh</hi> in them, nor <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> from them; a <hi>ſpiritual heart delights</hi> in things, and <hi>reliſheth</hi> them as they are <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual;</hi> that which <hi>much reliſheth</hi> a carnal heart, is very <hi>diſ-reliſhing</hi> to the Spiritual man. As, take a <hi>Carnal eare,</hi> that loves to hear things where there is a great deale of curioſity, and of the varniſh of Humane wit and Wiſdome; but now take a <hi>Spiritual eare,</hi> that delights to hear ſuch things as have in them evidence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Spirit and power, and findes a diſ-reliſhing of other things. So take a <hi>Carnal eye,</hi> that delights to behold ſuch things as pleaſe the Natural ſenſe, and delight the Fancy; but now, a <hi>Spiritual ſoul,</hi> that delights to behold ſuch things as may elevate the Soul, and raiſe the affections more towards Heaven; ſo take a <hi>Carnal heart,</hi> that is well pleaſed when it is exerciſed about toyes, this vaine needleſs queſtion and the other; but now a <hi>Spiritual heart,</hi> that can take no comfortable
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:115823:181"/>reliſh in things of this nature, but they are <hi>dry</hi> and <hi>empty</hi> unto it, and therefore it ſhuns and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyds them, and ſo eſcapes the danger that comes by them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Becauſe <hi>ſuch a heart as is exerciſed in, and taken up with Spiritual things, lives (as I may ſay) in another world, whither theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours which make the braines of many men giddy, and their converſation unſtedfaſt, doe not aſcend;</hi> he lives in the <hi>heavenly world,</hi> and is a Citizen of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above, where he is free, and not annoyed with ſuch things as others are who live below; the ayre that hee breathes in is pure, and not infected with ſuch vapours; the food that he feeds upon turnes to Spiritual nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and doth not beget crudities and ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the Soul; and by reaſon of this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful change of place, ayre, and food, there is likewiſe ſuch a change wrought in his temper and conſtitution, as that his nature will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with, or brook the principles and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men who live here below, and ſpeak and act as children of this world.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Becauſe <hi>a heart exerciſed about Spiritual things, hath ends and deſignes which he findes he can never accompliſh in ſuch wayes.</hi> His <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>deſignes</hi> are, that hee may glorifie God, edifie his Brother by what hee ſayes and does, and have the peace and comfort of it in his owne Conſcience; that through his knowledge his Corruptions may bee mortified, his Graces quickned, &amp;c. now he findes, that <hi>he can never accompliſh his ends and deſignes</hi> by ſtudying quaint and curious Notions, but rather is ſet
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115823:181"/>further off, his owne corruptions by but look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards them, gathers ſtrength, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tops Grace upon the ſudden; inſtead of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honour to God, God is diſhonoured; his Brother, inſtead of receiving edification, is in danger of being ſeduced and carried together with him out of the way of truth, and all his ſolid Soul-humbling inward peace degenerates into a kind of phantaſtick and ſelf-conceited joy; ſo that of neceſſity he muſt let fall his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and take up a worſe if ever hee goe in this way, the fore-fight and conſideration whereof, makes him ſhie and averſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Hence wee may learne <hi>what is the grand cauſe of all thoſe errours and evils which ſwarme and abound in this our age;</hi> why, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hearts are not exerciſed in ſpiritual things.</hi> Should one come and ask me a reaſon of the too ſtrange and lamentable miſtakes, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miſcarriages, ſo palpable and common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many, profeſſing themſelves to bee Saints in theſe our dayes; how it comes to paſs, or what is the reaſon that thoſe who formerly were one, ſhould now bee ſo many; who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the moſt entire affections that could be, ſhould now hate one another; who were ſo lively and active, ſhould now bee ſo dead and ſleepy; who thought they could never doe enough, ſhould now caſt off all; I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, I know none more probable than this, <hi>Chriſtians hearts are not ſo exerciſed about high and Spiritual things as once they were.</hi> Chriſtians that once were taken up with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:115823:182"/>things, as Prayer, Reading, Hearing, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating of the Word, watching and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their owne hearts, and theſe too in a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual manner, have now either laid theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, or are grown more cold and formal in their exerciſing in them.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerved it amongſt Chriſtians in our dayes, that one day ſuch <hi>an opinion</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad you ſhall have one tampering with that, and there he drops a little of his <hi>ſpirituality;</hi> by and by with another, and there hee drops a little more; then another, there too he drops a little <hi>more,</hi> till in the end his <hi>ſpirituality</hi> (I meane that ſpiritual frame of heart which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had) <hi>is quite loſt;</hi> which being gone, he is like another man, as peeviſh, fooliſh, light-ſpirited as any. And if I miſtake not, it is one of the Devils <hi>greateſt deſignes</hi> in the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of <hi>opinions,</hi> by degrees to eate out that <hi>power and life of godlineſſe in the hearts of Saints,</hi> which by force and violence of temptation hee could never work out; herein dealing like a politick Warriour, who finding a place too ſtrong to attempt by open force, by ſecret and ſubtil undermining gets into it.</p>
                  <p>It fares in this caſe with Chriſtians as with a man that toucheth Pitch, let him touch it ever ſo lightly yet ſomewhat of it will ſtick to him; ſo whilſt Chriſtians are tampering with opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, though ever ſo lightly, yet a tincture remains, ſomething thereof cleaves to their ſpirits, and ſteales from them ſomething of their ſpirituality; as for example, it is ſome mens opinion, that a man need never pray
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:115823:182"/>except in private ejaculations; now though perhaps your hearts cannot fully own it, yet is there not ſome tincture of it, ſome duſt cleaving to your ſpirits? And as for this one, ſo alſo there are opinions abroad againſt all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, your hearts cannot cloſe with ſuch things, and yet perhaps by hearing theſe things, and talking with perſons this way, ſome tincture hereof cleaves to you, ſo as that you grow more ſlighty in hearing, reading, meditation, and every other Ordinance than formerly you were. Something of your former ſpirituality hereby is loſt and extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>This (as I have ſaid), as far as I am able to judge, is the <hi>grand cauſe of all the errors and evils that are amongſt Chriſtians,</hi> the Devil by degrees ſteals away their hearts from <hi>exerciſing in ſpiritual things;</hi> and having ſo done, then they grow like other men, this toy which once they would have thought unworthy of their time or thoughts, takes up both; and this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice which once their hearts would have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred and trembled at, they now imbrace, making no bones of it, and the root of all is, <hi>a neglecting of ſpiritual things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. As this ſhews us the cauſe of the fall and Apoſtacy of many perſons, ſo alſo this tells us, <hi>That there are many who yet are not tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that ſtand upon ſlippery ground, and will tumble in time if they do not come off it.</hi> Art thou a man or woman, which time hath been, haſt had thy heart warm to ſpiritual things, and ſpiritual works, and doth thy heart now grow cold to things of this nature, and art thou
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115823:183"/>warm to every curious notion, and new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, thou art the perſon I ſpeak to, and Soul let mee tell thee, thou art upon ſlippery ground, if thou comeſt not off, thou wilt tumble. You know how it is with a horſe that goes rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt upon the Ice, a little time he goes well, but within a while the Ice wears off his rough-caſt, and hee grows ſmooth, and then down hee tumbles. So thou art one who haſt had ſome favour, and art rough-caſt, and thou walkeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into opinions, and brave conceits which pleaſe thy fancy, and a while thou ſtandeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there hath been ſome favour, ſome ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality upon thy heart, which hath rough-caſt thee, but in time walking in this way, thy rough-caſt is by degrees worn off, and thou groweſt ſmooth, and then down thou tumbleſt. Take heed, come off this ſlippery ground before thy rough-caſt be worn away; for if thou doſt not, aſſuredly ſo ſoon as that ſhall bee, thou wilt fall, and if God of his great mercy do not ſet thee on thy legs, thou wilt never get up ſo as to ſtand and walk again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Wouldeſt thou bee delivered from the dangerous errrors and evils of the times and places thou doſt live in? then in the third place, <hi>Imbrace this remedy, get thy heart exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in, and taken up with ſpiritual things.</hi> I need ſay no more by way of motive, than to repeat over the Doctrine, <hi>viz. That the way for a Saint to bee delivered from the errors and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of the times hee lives in, is, to have his heart as much as may bee taken up with, and his ſpirit exerciſed about high and ſpiritual things.</hi> Yet
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115823:183"/>becauſe our hearts are ſo dull of hearing, that a great deal ſaid moves them but a little, I ſhall therefore beſides the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> lay ſome few <hi>other motives</hi> before you to ſtir up to this, to have our hearts more exerciſed in, and taken up with ſpiritual things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Conſider, <hi>This is the way, a ſpecial way to maintain peace in thine own ſoul.</hi> Were a mans abode in the upper region of the aire, hee ſhould neither bee troubled with ſtorms or cloudings, becauſe hee ſhould bee above all. So ſoul, were thy heart and minde alwayes taken up with <hi>ſpiritual things</hi> in a <hi>ſpiritual manner,</hi> wee ſhould bee more free from ſtormes within, more free from the cloudings of Gods face than now wee are; wee ſhould have more inward calme, and Sun-ſhine of Gods love in a day, than now perhaps wee have in a month.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>This alſo is the way to end diviſions amongſt Saints.</hi> The way to <hi>cure</hi> a diſeaſe is to take away the <hi>cauſe:</hi> What is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt Saints, but the not <hi>exerciſing of our hearts about ſpiritual things.</hi> The <hi>root</hi> of our diviſions is our <hi>carnality,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.3, 4. <hi>For yee are yet carnal: For whereas there is among you envying, and ſtrife, and diviſions, are yee not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and walke as men? For while one ſaith, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollo, are yee not carnal?</hi> When Chriſtians who ſhould bee one, divide themſelves and make parties, one party ſetting themſelves might and maine againſt the other, it is a ſigne that they are <hi>carnal;</hi> but now as Saints come to bee <hi>more ſpiritual,</hi> and more taken up with <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> they come
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:115823:184"/>to ſee their own folly and childiſhneſs in theſe things, they come to look upon, and have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Saints as they are Saints, as they have the Image of God upon them, Chriſt in them, The <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Chriſtian loves what God loves, and where God loves; now God loves his own Image in all, and all as they have this Image upon them. Thus the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Chriſtian who is taken up with <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> loves, and hath fellowſhip with Saints as they are Saints; whoever they are which hee ſees to bee ſuch (if there bee not ſome eminent blot either upon their converſations or judgements, which after admonitions remaining, ſo as that the glory of God, and the honour of the Goſpel, calls aloud for withdrawing communion from them) hee dares not but to love them, own them, and have fellowſhip with them as God doth, and as hee himſelf hereafter in heaven ſhall do, Now this exceedingly heals, and makes up breaches amongſt the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>The exerciſing of the heart about ſpiritual things, is the way to diſ-enamour a mans heart of the world.</hi> The way to <hi>diſ-enamour</hi> a man of a baſe and vulgar perſon, is to have his heart <hi>ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured</hi> with a perſon of great worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. So the way to <hi>diſ-enamour</hi> our hearts of low, carnal, and earthly things, is to have them <hi>enamoured</hi> with high ſpiritual, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. <hi>If you bee riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke things above where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God.</hi> Chriſts ſitting at the right hand of God, is a motive to us to ſeek things above; as if hee ſhould ſay, Would
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:115823:184"/>you have your hearts <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> bee much in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of this, <hi>Chriſt is above,</hi> hee is at the right hand of God; and ſay, What is my head above, my husband above, my Saviour, my all above, and ſhall I minde things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low?</p>
                  <p>O Chriſtians were you buſied in <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> you would bee leſſe buſie with the <hi>world;</hi> Were your hearts and thoughts more taken up about your union with Chriſt, your juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, your inheritance you are called to, &amp;c. you would not root in the world as yee doe. Moles root themſelves in the earth, but Birds do not, becauſe they flye aloft; they are much above, and take no delight to root in the earth: Bee as the Bird, but not as the Mole, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>The exerciſing of the heart about ſpiritual things, begets a ſweet diſpoſedneſſe of ſpirit both to, in, and after every duty;</hi> It diſpoſeth the heart <hi>to a duty,</hi> ſuch a heart is in a <hi>frame</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> at any time, to ſpeak a ſpiritual word at any time, when hee ſees a call thereto; other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians they have a heart to a ſpiritual work to day it may bee, but finde not a heart for a week together at another time: When they are to go to a duty, they have a great deal ado to get their hearts up to what they are going about, their hearts are in the world, in their profits and pleaſures, and as their duty calls on one hand, theſe call on the other, and not without much ado do they bring their hearts from theſe to their duty, whereas this heart that is <hi>taken up with ſpiritual things,</hi> is ready for the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:115823:185"/>duty when ever it calls.</p>
                  <p>And as to a <hi>duty,</hi> ſo alſo it doth ſweetly diſpoſe <hi>the heart in a duty.</hi> It is ſaid of Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> that hee never came off from a duty without enjoying ſomewhat of God therein: A <hi>ſpiritual heart</hi> injoyes more of God many times in <hi>one duty,</hi> than another doth in <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo <hi>after a duty,</hi> a ſpiritual heart walks ſweetly and bravely <hi>after a duty:</hi> You ſhall have others come, and get up a little comfort <hi>in a duty,</hi> and when they have got a little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, they will walk baſely, they will run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves head and ears into the world, untill they have quite loſt all that comfort and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they had with God <hi>in the duty.</hi> But now a <hi>ſpiritual heart</hi> (if yours and mine were ſuch) after hee hath been at a duty, and met with God there, his converſation is like <hi>Moſes</hi> face when hee came off the Mount, it ſhines; his behaviour, ſpeeches, actions, his carriage towards Saints and ſinners ſhines, there is a luſtre, a beauty, a glory upon them; as it was ſaid of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> ſeeing their boldneſs and undauntedneſs, and conſidering they were unlearned, and ignorant men, they took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them that they had been with Jeſus. So the carriage and words, and behaviour of a <hi>ſpiritual heart,</hi> after hee comes off from a duty where hee hath met with God, is ſuch, that by ſpeaking with him, and hearing of him, you may ſay, there is a man, a woman that hath been with Jeſus, hee walks, hee talks as one that hath met with Jeſus.</p>

                  <p n="5">5 <hi>By exerciſing the heart about ſpiritual things, a man ſhall be brought up to a bleſſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſſe, and ſtayedneſſe of heart upon God, in all the alterations, changes, and turnes of things here below; turnes</hi> in the World, <hi>change</hi> of Diſpenſations doe often times put another man <hi>out</hi> of his courſe.

It is one thing to bee a Proteſtant, another to bee a Chriſtian; one thing to bee reformed upon the ſame root, another thing to bee made altogether new; Papiſts may become Proteſtants, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Churches obtain another name, but what is Antichriſtian in Conſtitution, cannot bee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in Reformation; reform a Beaſt, yet though tame, gentle, better ordered every way, it is a Beaſt ſtill.</p>

                     <hi>The New Covenant was not in its conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after the Old, but before it.

It is called therefore <hi>New,</hi> reſpecting the <hi>Old,</hi> not in the <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> but <hi>Revelation</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2 Conſent and acceptation is not neceſſary to the conſtitution of the Covenant,</hi> as Gods Covenant with every living creature that hee would drown the world no more, <hi>Gen. 9.10.</hi> was not founded in the <hi>conſent</hi> of the creature, but in the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>purpoſe</hi> of God.

                     <hi>4 The New Covenant, is a Covenant of Grace, not in a large ſenſe only,</hi> for ſo the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> was of Grace, the Lord did no more owe unto man <hi>a Covenant</hi> than <hi>Creation;</hi> but in a <hi>ſpecial ſenſe,</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> from the <hi>old Covenant,</hi> viz. in <hi>freeneſs,</hi> in <hi>fulneſs,</hi> in <hi>firmneſs.</hi>

                     <hi>1 The New Covenant is a free and abſolute Covenant,</hi> Jer. <hi>31.33.</hi> Heb. <hi>8.10.</hi> where the termes are not, <hi>I will if yee will,</hi> but <hi>I will, and yee ſhall,</hi> the Lord being the only <hi>taking party,</hi> and <hi>active</hi> in making the <hi>Covenant,</hi> man being <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,</hi> and <hi>taken into it,</hi> long before he <hi>taketh hold</hi> upon it, or upon Chriſt in it; it is called therefore the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> it being the <hi>nature</hi> of a <hi>Teſtament</hi> to diſpoſe of good things, without the concurrence of any <hi>precedent act</hi> as neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, to bee performed by them, to whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thoſe good things are diſpoſed of; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it is the <hi>New Teſtament in the Bloud of
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:115823:191"/>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Surety</hi> thereof; had <hi>Adam</hi> fulfilled the <hi>Condition</hi> of his <hi>Covenant,</hi> it had not remained <hi>conditionally</hi> to his Seed, but they had enjoyed Paradice though <hi>not without works,</hi> yet <hi>without works</hi> as the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of ſuch enjoyment.

                  <p>It is a famous queſtion, whether Faith bee the condition of the New Covenant, as Works were the condition of the Old, and argued with much ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſtrength on both ſides, although with: many it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>The New Covenant is pure and abſolute in reſpect of condition,</hi> many good from first to laſt being founded, not in the will of man, but of God; conſider it in the <hi>Decree,</hi> that is <hi>abſolute, and inconditional,</hi> and according to the good pleaſure of God, <hi>Epheſ. 1.5.</hi> a purpoſe of God which doth ſtand not of works, but of him which calleth, <hi>Rom. 9.11.</hi> Who hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, <hi>verſ. 15.</hi> If the <hi>Decree</hi> were <hi>conditional,</hi> it were no <hi>deceiver</hi> till after the <hi>Condition;</hi> did God <hi>decree</hi> to write Names in his Book upon <hi>condition</hi> they beleeve, repent, and

Tit. 1.2. Rev. 13.8.</hi> Conſider it in the <hi>execution,</hi> that is, <hi>abſolute alſo, and inconditional,</hi> as the <hi>Decree</hi> is: If the <hi>Decree of life</hi> bee <hi>antecedent</hi> to the <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> in order of nature, then <hi>faith</hi> is no <hi>condition</hi> unto <hi>life</hi> in the <hi>execution,</hi> though no man doth live without faith; or thus, If the <hi>Decree</hi> of glorifying of grace in the ſalvation of the creature, be <hi>antecedent</hi> to the ſanctification thereof, then ſanctification is no <hi>condition</hi> in the <hi>execution,</hi> though no man not ſanctified, be glorified for the Lord peremptorily decrees to ſanctifie, &amp; ſave; God doth not one thing for another, though one thing after another, therefore <hi>vocation</hi> is <hi>free,</hi> Rom. <hi>8.30.</hi> Matth. <hi>11.25, 26.</hi> Jam. <hi>1.18.

Heb. 7.27. 1 Pet. 3.18.</hi> ſo hee is made righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Old Covenant</hi> was a <hi>weak Covenant,</hi> not in commanding or condemning power, it is able to damn a whole world for diſobedience, but in helping a poor miſerable undone creature, <hi>Rom. 8.3.</hi> What can the Sun do for a blinde man, a Phyſitian may help nature, but cannot give it; the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> is like unto thoſe Phyſitians
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:115823:194"/>upon whom the woman that had the Bloody-iſſue waited twelve years, and ſpent all her ſubſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never the better, but the worſe. The <hi>New Covenant</hi> is like unto Chriſt, if wee touch but the hemm of that Garment, there is healing, which doth not onely declare a Law for the heart, but alſo write it upon the heart, not impoſe a duty onely, but diſpoſe unto obedience, adminiſtring not onely the letter, but the Spirit, <hi>2 Cor. 3.6.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Old Covenant</hi> is like unto <hi>Moſes</hi> the Miniſter thereof, who could not lead the people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Canaan.</hi> The <hi>New</hi> is like unto <hi>Joſhua</hi> a Type of our Jeſus, under whom the Tribes received their Inheritance. Compare the times of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and you will finde a <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of grace in <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> time. Compare the times of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Covenant,</hi> you will finde a <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of grace in the <hi>New Covenant</hi> time, <hi>exceeding fulneſſe,</hi> comparative with the former time.</p>

                     <hi>Abraham</hi> (as the Apoſtle tells us) had two Sons, one by <hi>Hagar,</hi> a <hi>Bond-woman,</hi> another by <hi>Sarah</hi> a <hi>Free-woman.</hi> Of theſe two, <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the Bond-womans Son, mocking at <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Free-womans, is adjudged; Firſt, by <hi>Sarah</hi> the <hi>Free-woman,</hi> after that by <hi>God himſelf,</hi> to bee caſt out. <hi>Caſt out, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words then Originally are but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what <hi>Sarah</hi> did motion to <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning the <hi>Bond-woman</hi> and her <hi>Son,</hi> viz.

                  </p>
                  <p>This is the literal meaning of the words, but our interpretation is not to reſt here, but to look further, <hi>viz.</hi> to that <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> that lies couched in them, for as one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal way of Gods Diſpenſation of truth to his people in Old Teſtament times was by Types, ſo the Apoſtle tells us plainly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.20. <hi>that theſe things were an Allegory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To finde out therefore the <hi>Myſtery</hi> wrapped up in the <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> it will bee needful that wee take a particular view of the ſeveral Types themſelves, which conjoyned doe make up this <hi>beautiful Allegory.</hi>

                  <p>Now for the better underſtanding hereof let us conſider, that as <hi>Hagar</hi> the <hi>Bond-woman,</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> her <hi>Son</hi> were <hi>Types</hi> on the one hand, ſo

                  <p>Before we enter upon the particulars of the words read and opened, take (by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſal to our whole Diſcourſe) theſe few gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Poſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 POSITION; <hi>That the application of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams <hi>Hiſtory ſo farre as it concernes</hi> Sarah and <hi>Hagar, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> to <hi>the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, is a thing that ſtands upon Divine war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;</hi> it is the Apoſtles Comment upon the Hiſtory, not ours; As none (had not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle led the way) might have been ſo bold to have put ſuch an interpretation upon this Hiſtory, ſo none, the Apoſtle being in this the Holy Ghoſts Penman, may take upon them to correct, or condemn it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 POSITION; <hi>That the two Covenants are two diverſe and diſtinct Covenants, and not one and the ſame Covenant under two adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> for <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> are <hi>not one</hi> and the ſame, but two <hi>diſtinct</hi> perſons, yea ſo <hi>diſtinct</hi> as that they admit not of a reconciliation, for <hi>Hagar</hi> is a <hi>Bond-woman, Sarah</hi> a <hi>Free-woman;</hi> now <hi>bondage</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> are <hi>contraries</hi> which can never be reconciled.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 POSITION; <hi>That the ground of this diſtinction betwixt the two Covenants doth not lye in regard of time, as if ſo be this were the bottome of the diſtinction, that the Old Covenant related to Old Teſtament times, and the New to New
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:115823:199"/>Teſtament,</hi> for <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> doe both <hi>exiſt</hi> in the time of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and though they are contrary to each other, yet they both continue together in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, from the firſt day of their entrance until the Seed is come, to which the Promiſe is made. In like manner the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Covenant</hi> both had <hi>being</hi> even in the Church of God, until the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time was come in which Chriſt the true Seed was borne into the world.</p>
                  <p>This duly weighed frees our <hi>former Poſition</hi> from ſuch charges as might otherwiſe bee brought againſt it, and doth alſo help us to the knowledge of ſome very uſeful truthes; for note hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>That Saints of the Old Teſtament were not ſaved one way, wee another;</hi> they by the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> we by the <hi>New;</hi> for they had <hi>Sarah,</hi> the <hi>New Covenant</hi> with them, as well as wee have, and all the claime they had, or laid to the heavenly inheritance was by vertue of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs</hi> right, not <hi>Hagars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>That Saints of the Old Teſtament, as they were ſaved in the ſame way with us, ſo alſo had they the ſame communion with God, and bleſſings that we enjoy;</hi> for they had <hi>Sarah</hi> with them, therefore the <hi>bleſſing</hi> of <hi>Sarah,</hi> and <hi>communion</hi> with God by <hi>Sarah</hi> was their portion then, as well as ours now; only with this <hi>difference,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Sarah,</hi> the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> all that time, though ſhe had the promiſe of fruitfulneſſe had not brought forth as now ſhee hath, therefore their <hi>communion</hi> with God chiefly lay <hi>in hope</hi> of a Seed to <hi>come,</hi> ours <hi>in faith</hi> of a Seed <hi>come;</hi>
                     <pb n="367" facs="tcp:115823:199"/>they lived in continual <hi>expectation</hi> of a glorious bleſſing which by faith in the Promiſe they clearly fore-ſaw to come, and to bee exhibited; we in <hi>actual enjoyment</hi> of the bleſſing come, and exhibited.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>That the Doctrine of the Old Teſtament fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth us with New Covenant truth: and New Covenant Principles as well as the New;</hi> becauſe <hi>Sarah</hi> exiſting all that time as well as <hi>Hagar, Sarah</hi> gives commands, makes promiſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth threats as well as <hi>Hagar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence the matter of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> is not <hi>wholly legal,</hi> but it containeth in it <hi>pure Goſpel matter</hi> as well as the <hi>New.</hi> As that <hi>Doctrine</hi> which is no other but a <hi>meer voyce of words,</hi> or the ſound of a <hi>conditional Covenant,</hi> whether you finde it in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> or the <hi>New,</hi> belongs to the <hi>old Covenant;</hi> ſo that <hi>Doctrine</hi> which is a word of <hi>ſpirit and power,</hi> holding forth a free and abſolute <hi>Covenant,</hi> whether it be in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> or <hi>New,</hi> belongs to the <hi>New Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſhewes as the <hi>Authority,</hi> ſo alſo the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> even in <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment times,</hi> and to ſuch as are the Seed or Off-ſpring of <hi>Sarah,</hi> the <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> for a great part of the will of <hi>Sarah</hi> their <hi>Mother</hi> is there <hi>laid downe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>That the Saints of the Old Teſtament were under a two-fold Covenant, the Old and the New</hi> both; <hi>Hagar,</hi> until the <hi>appointed time</hi> is come that <hi>Sarah</hi> hath brought forth, continues with <hi>Sarah</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, and <hi>Abraham</hi> hath to doe now with <hi>Hagar,</hi> then with <hi>Sarah.</hi> So
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:115823:200"/>Saints throughout the time of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> ſtood under either <hi>Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New,</hi> and ſometimes in the matters of their faith, their comfort, and obedience, they had to doe with the one, ſometimes with the other.</p>
                  <p>Hence it comes to paſs that ordinarily the <hi>faith,</hi> comfort, and obedience of <hi>Old Teſtament Saints</hi> was more legal, more built upon <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of their walking and working, than wee finde the faith of the <hi>New Teſtament Saints</hi> (who lived after Chriſts Reſurrection in the time of the Apoſtles) to be; becauſe the firſt having to doe with <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> both, did as well partake of <hi>Hagars</hi> bondage, as <hi>Sarahs</hi> freedome, but the latter knowing <hi>Hagar</hi> now to be <hi>an out-caſt,</hi> and thereupon having to doe with <hi>Sarah</hi> only, felt not (as the former) the bondage of <hi>Hagar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This conſideration helps us with the maine and <hi>principal difference</hi> betwixt the <hi>Old and New Teſtament.</hi> All the time of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> whilſt yet <hi>Sarah</hi> hath not brought forth her Seed, <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> both dwell together in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, and <hi>Abraham</hi> (the Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) hath a kind of <hi>dependance</hi> on both, an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to both. But in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, when <hi>Sarahs</hi> ſeed is come forth, then <hi>Hagar</hi> and her <hi>ſeed</hi> are <hi>caſt out</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and now <hi>Abraham</hi> (the true Beleever) hath nothing to doe with <hi>Hagar</hi> or her <hi>ſeed</hi> any more, as once hee had, but his <hi>ſole dependance</hi> is upon <hi>Sarah,</hi> and the all of his affection to her ſeed.</p>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:115823:200"/>
                  <p n="4">4 POSITION; <hi>That the two Covenants are not two diverſe Covenants of grace,</hi> for if ſo, then the Children of each ſhould be Children of grace; but <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> the child of the <hi>Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> is not a childe of grace; <hi>outward bleſſings,</hi> and not <hi>inward grace,</hi> is his portion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21. Although a <hi>true childe of grace</hi> may have to doe with the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> the Father of the faithful went in unto <hi>Hagar;</hi> yet the <hi>Childe</hi> of the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> cannot bee a <hi>childe of grace,</hi> as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the Son of <hi>Hagar</hi> was not.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 POSITION; <hi>That the two Covenants in the matters of our Juſtification and Salvation ought by no means to be confounded, mixt, or joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, but to be ſeparated from each other at the greateſt diſtance that can be,</hi> for God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath made this ſeparation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 By commanding the old Covenant to bee <hi>caſt out.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>

                  <p>This <hi>ſhuffling</hi> of the <hi>Old and New Covenant</hi> together, is the <hi>very ſeed</hi> of all <hi>doubting,</hi> and the <hi>greateſt enemy</hi> that can bee to the <hi>life of faith,</hi> repugnant to a Goſpel-ſtate in which theſe two are <hi>ſeparated,</hi> and contrary to the word of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> which commands the <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of theſe, and the <hi>New Teſtament Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi> which are thoſe onely that are made able rightly to divide the word of truth, <hi>i.e. diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh</hi> betwixt the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Covenant.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> proves himſelf to bee an <hi>able Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. not from his learning or parts, or his being brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> but from hence, becauſe hee had a <hi>clear diſtinct knowledge,</hi> not of the things of the <hi>Letter,</hi> or the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> onely, but alſo of the things of both <hi>Letter and Spirit, i.e. Old</hi> and <hi>New Covenant</hi> both; being hereby able to judge of the things of either, and <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> rightly betwixt them.

                  <p>Anſw. <hi>Of the whole Law, as well that which is Moral, as that which is Ceremonial and Political;</hi> as is clear by very many Arguments left us in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles: Onely ere I produce any let

                  <p>Now the <hi>Arguments</hi> inforcing the <hi>former concluſion,</hi> That not the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> and <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law onely,</hi> but the <hi>Moral alſo,</hi> appertaines to the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> are theſe.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Arg.</hi> That <hi>Law</hi> which the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> brake, and were <hi>rejected</hi> for breach of, is of the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> as is clear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8, 9. with verſ. 13. But this was not the <hi>Ceremonial Law onely,</hi> but the <hi>Moral alſo,</hi> which therefore is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly called the <hi>Covenant</hi> made with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Deut. 4.13. <hi>And hee declared unto you his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which hee commanded you to perform, even Ten Commandements, and hee wrote them upon two Tables of ſtone.</hi> And indeed who ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the ſtory of their going into Captivity,

                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Arg.</hi> That <hi>Law</hi> which ſtands in a <hi>direct oppoſition</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> written in the heart, muſt belong to the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> for <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.9, 10. The Apoſtle <hi>oppoſing</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> together, makes the <hi>oppoſition</hi> or the <hi>New Covenants</hi> part to lye in this as one principal thing, <hi>I will write my Laws in their hearts,</hi> therefore the <hi>Law</hi> which ſtands <hi>moſt oppoſite</hi> unto <hi>this Law</hi> of the heart muſt bee a part, yea a main part of the <hi>Old Covenant.</hi> But this is the <hi>Law</hi> written and engraven in Tables of ſtone, and that is die <hi>Moral Law.</hi> And that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>Law</hi> written in <hi>Tables of ſtone</hi> doth in <hi>Pauls</hi> ſenſe ſtand in <hi>direct oppoſition</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant</hi> written in the <hi>Tables of the heart,</hi> is evident, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. where the Apoſtle himſelf hath ſet theſe two in <hi>direct oppoſition</hi> each to the other.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Arg.</hi> That Law which is a <hi>killing letter;</hi> and a <hi>miniſtration of death</hi> and <hi>condemnation</hi> is of, and belongs to the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> which is dear, becauſe the Apoſtle tells us, it was to bee <hi>done away,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6, 7. <hi>i.e.</hi> God in the <hi>firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> of it had an intent to <hi>abrogate</hi> it for future, yea is <hi>done away,</hi> verſ. 11. <hi>i.e. abrogated</hi> to beleevers now under the Goſpel. But now God inſtituted nothing with purpoſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to abrogate it for future, nor is there any thing once <hi>instituted</hi> by God now <hi>abrogated,</hi> but what is of, did belong to the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> therefore ſuch muſt that <hi>Law</hi> bee which is a
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:115823:205"/>
                     <hi>killing letter, &amp;c.</hi> But this is no other but the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> ergo.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>Arg.</hi> The <hi>Moral Law</hi> is expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to bee a part of the <hi>Old Covenant.</hi> This wee have <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1. with verſ. 5. The firſt (or <hi>old Covenant</hi>) had in it both Ordinances of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, and the Tables of the Covenant, <hi>i.e. Moral Law,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial</hi> both.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 <hi>Arg.</hi> That <hi>Law</hi> which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul disputes againſt</hi> in the ſeventh of the <hi>Romans,</hi> is of the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> becauſe the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that Law that hee <hi>diſputes againſt</hi> to bee <hi>abrogated,</hi> verſ. 4.6. But nothing (as I have ſaid) is <hi>abrogated</hi> but what is of the <hi>Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> But the Law the Apoſtle doth there <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt</hi> is no other but the <hi>Moral Law;</hi> for hee ſpeaks of that <hi>Law</hi> that makes <hi>diſcovery of ſin,</hi> which is the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> yea makes parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mention of the <hi>laſt Precept</hi> of the <hi>Law, Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> verſ. 7. Therefore the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> as well as the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> is of the <hi>Old Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7 <hi>Arg.</hi> That <hi>Law</hi> which the Apoſtle <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes againſt</hi> throughout this Epiſtle, proving that wee are not, nor cannot bee juſtified by it, is the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> as is evident, becauſe hee brings in this <hi>Allegory</hi> of <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> as the <hi>cloſe</hi> of his <hi>diſputation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> ſtrengthning all his former Arguments by it, as by a moſt convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing demonſtration to this effect, <hi>Hagar</hi> the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> is commanded of God to bee <hi>caſt out,</hi> therefore the Law cannot <hi>juſtifie.</hi> Now in caſe the Law the Apoſtle had been <hi>diſputing againſt</hi> had been one thing, and <hi>Hagar</hi> the <hi>Old
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:115823:205"/>Covenant</hi> another, there could have been no <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,</hi> theſe two therefore muſt bee one and the ſame. But now the Law the Apoſtle <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes againſt</hi> throughout this Epiſtle, is not the <hi>Ceremonial onely,</hi> but the <hi>Moral</hi> alſo; For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The Apoſtle <hi>diſputes againſt</hi> that <hi>Law</hi> that the <hi>Galatians</hi> ſought <hi>juſtification</hi> by, but this was not the <hi>Ceremonial Law onely</hi> (as is proved in my firſt Argument) but the <hi>Moral alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Apoſtle <hi>diſputes againſt</hi> that <hi>Law</hi> which would <hi>fruſtrate</hi> the grace of God, and render Chriſts death <hi>in vain,</hi> in caſe righteouſnes were attainable by it. For this is one of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, Chap. 2.22. <hi>I do not fruſtrate the grace of God, &amp;c.</hi> But in caſe righteouſneſs were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> it would as much <hi>fruſtrate</hi> the grace of God, and render Chriſts death <hi>in vain</hi> as it could do, though the ſame were attainable by the <hi>Ceremonial.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> as well as the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> is the <hi>Law</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>diſputes againſt,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 That <hi>Law</hi> the <hi>tenor</hi> whereof runs thus, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> is the Law the Apoſtle <hi>diſputes againſt,</hi> as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. where the Apoſtle ſets that Law, which ſaith, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> in oppoſition unto <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the thing hee pleads for. But this is the <hi>tenor</hi> of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> Deut. 5.33. Levit. 18.5. <hi>ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 That <hi>Law</hi> which pronounceth a <hi>dreadful curſe,</hi> and brings all thoſe unavoidably under this <hi>curſe</hi> that ſtand under it, is the Law the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>diſputes againſt,</hi> as his urging the <hi>curſe</hi>
                     <pb n="380" facs="tcp:115823:206"/>of the <hi>Law</hi> as a mighty Argument againſt <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> by it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. doth clearly prove. But this is no other but the <hi>Moral Law, ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 That <hi>Law</hi> which Chriſts death was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſatisfie for the breach of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to remove the <hi>curſe</hi> of it from beleevers, is the Law the Apoſtle <hi>diſputes againſt,</hi> as verſ. 13. makes appear. But this was the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> ergo.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 That <hi>Law</hi> which is ſo <hi>oppoſite</hi> to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> that in caſe the inheritance were by it, it could not bee <hi>by the promiſe,</hi> is the Law the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>diſputes against,</hi> which his Argument urged, verſ. 17, 18. proveth. But this cannot bee the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> which in it ſelf carried no contrariety to the <hi>promiſe,</hi> but maintained a ſweet concurrence and harmony with the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> being indeed no other but the <hi>promiſe vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> the <hi>promiſe</hi> clad in <hi>Types,</hi> and <hi>figures,</hi> therefore muſt bee the <hi>Moral;</hi> which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Law the Apoſtle <hi>diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,</hi> ergo.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 That Law which was added becauſe of tranſgreſſions, and <hi>ordained by Angels</hi> in the hand of a Mediator, is the Law the Apoſtle <hi>diſputes againſt,</hi> Chap. 3.19. for leſt they ſhould think that by his former Arguments hee had <hi>wholly deſtroyed</hi> the Law, and made it <hi>uſeleſſe,</hi> he therefore brings in theſe words as an anſwer to the Queſtion, what <hi>uſe</hi> the <hi>Law ordained by Angels</hi> could bee put to if it, could not <hi>juſtifie,</hi> ſo that it is plain the Law here mentioned is the very ſame with that Law hee had before
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:115823:206"/>
                     <hi>bent</hi> his Arguments againſt. But the <hi>Law added</hi> becauſe of tranſgreſſions, and <hi>ordained by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> in the hand of a Mediator, none do, or can deny to bee the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> ergo.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 That <hi>Law</hi> which was a <hi>School-maſter</hi> to Gods people under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> to teach them duty, and correct them for their faults, is the <hi>Law</hi> Apoſtle <hi>diſputes againſt,</hi> as is clear, becauſe upon the coming of faith, hee caſts the <hi>School-maſter</hi> out of doors, verſ. 24.25. <hi>i. e. ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>School-maſter.</hi> But now the <hi>Law</hi> which was the <hi>School-maſter</hi> to teach Gods people under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them for their faults, was not the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law</hi> (which was unto them a help, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and reliefe againſt their faults) but the <hi>Moral,</hi> ergo,</p>
                  <p n="9">9 And laſtly, That <hi>Law</hi> which requires of us that wee ſhould <hi>love our neighbour as our ſelves,</hi> is the Law the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle had been <hi>diſputing againſt,</hi> for hee brings in thoſe words, Chap. 5.14. as an expoſition of that Law, which they ſtood ſo much for, and yet did ſo groſſy abuſe and miſtake; therefore the <hi>Law of loving our neighbour</hi> is for ſubſtance tile very ſame Law with that his <hi>diſputation</hi> had run upon. But the <hi>Law of loving our neighbour as our ſelves</hi> is the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> for theſe words are the <hi>ſumme</hi> of the ſecond Table thereof, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.39. <hi>ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8 <hi>Arg.</hi> My eighth and laſt Argument, I take from the Apoſtles <hi>Allegory,</hi> out of which I have taken my Text, and it is this, That Law which was <hi>given upon Mount Sinai</hi> is the <hi>Old
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:115823:207"/>Covenant,</hi> for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia.</hi> But the <hi>Law given upon Mount Sinai,</hi> was not the <hi>Ceremonial onely,</hi> but the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral alſo,</hi> ergo.</p>
                  <p>The Concluſion is, That by the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> wee are to underſtand the <hi>whole Law,</hi> as well the <hi>Moral part,</hi> as the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> and <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection.</hi> But here ariſeth a great Objection upon us, <hi>viz.</hi> That by proving the <hi>Moral Law</hi> to belong to the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> and affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> is to bee <hi>caſt out,</hi> wee have deſtroyed and made void the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> yea not the <hi>Ten Commandements</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> onely, but moreover by our <hi>large acception</hi> of the word. <hi>Moral,</hi> wee have made null, and overthrowne <hi>all manner of Duties</hi> whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer, Not ſo,</hi> and that it may appear that it is <hi>not ſo;</hi> Mark well what I am to ſay, That as there is <hi>ſomething</hi> in the <hi>Moral Law</hi> that appertaines to <hi>Hagar,</hi> is a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;</hi> ſo alſo <hi>ſomething</hi> there is in the <hi>Moral Law</hi> that appertaines to <hi>Sarah</hi> is a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> for the <hi>Moral Law</hi> is <hi>Hagars rule</hi> and <hi>Sarahs</hi> both.</p>
                  <p>Now all our diſcourſe hitherto upon the <hi>Moral Law</hi> hath run upon it no otherwiſe but as the ſame is the Law of <hi>Hagar,</hi> a part of the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> and taken in this ſenſe, it is no injury to the <hi>holy Law</hi> of God, to ſay, it muſt bee <hi>cast out:</hi> But if wee take the <hi>Moral Law</hi> as it is <hi>Sarahs rule,</hi> it is then a moſt ungodly and prophane aſſertion to ſay it muſt bee <hi>caſt out:</hi> For obſerve, though the <hi>Bond-woman</hi> is
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:115823:207"/>to bee <hi>caſt out,</hi> and all that appertaines to her, yet there is no <hi>caſting out</hi> of the <hi>Free-woman,</hi> nor of any thing that appertaines to her. Whatſoever therefore that is of the <hi>Moral law</hi> which appertaines to the <hi>Bond-woman,</hi> the, <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> all that wee may, yea ought to <hi>caſt out,</hi> but contrariwiſe, whatſoever that is that belongs to the <hi>Free-woman</hi> (is a part or peece of the <hi>New Covenant</hi>) that muſt wee by no meanes meddle with, there is no <hi>caſting out</hi> of that, for though the <hi>ſervant</hi> abideth not in the houſe for ever, yet the <hi>Miſtresse</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth for ever.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion here will bee, What is that of the <hi>Moral Law</hi> which doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the <hi>Bond-woman,</hi> and what that which appertains to the <hi>Free-woman?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Moral law</hi> conſiſts of three parts. 1 The <hi>mandatory</hi> or commanding part. 2 The <hi>Minatory</hi> or threatning part. 3 The <hi>Conſolatory</hi> or promiſing part. In every of which the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> or <hi>Bond-woman</hi> hath a ſhare as well as the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> or <hi>Free-woman:</hi> For note, The <hi>Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> hath <hi>promiſes,</hi> as well as <hi>commands</hi> and <hi>threatnings,</hi> for which reaſon the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Covenants of promiſe</hi> in the plural number, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. noting that the <hi>old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> as well as the <hi>New,</hi> hath <hi>promiſes,</hi> and tells us that the <hi>New</hi> is eſtabliſhed upon <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, promiſes,</hi> Heb. 8.6. ſhewing that the <hi>Old,</hi> is eſtabliſhed upon <hi>Promiſes</hi> too, but not ſo <hi>good promiſes</hi> as the <hi>New</hi> built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:115823:208"/>
                  <p>Againe, the <hi>New Covenant</hi> hath <hi>Commands,</hi> and <hi>Threatnings</hi> alſo, if wee wax wanton un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>grace</hi> thereof, as well as <hi>promiſes;</hi> and hence it is that the <hi>Gospel,</hi> the bleſſed word of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> is ſo full of <hi>heavenly precepts,</hi> and <hi>threats</hi> of fatherly <hi>chaſtiſement,</hi> therefore I ſay, both <hi>Old</hi> and New <hi>Covenant</hi> ſhare in either of the three foregoing parts.</p>
                  <p>Now out of theſe three to divide to each their <hi>proper portions,</hi> giving the <hi>Bond-woman</hi> hers, and the <hi>Free-woman</hi> hers, will clear up to us what is to bee <hi>caſt out,</hi> and what to <hi>remaine,</hi> for (as I have ſaid) that which belongs to the <hi>Bond-woman</hi> is to be <hi>caſt out,</hi> and that which is the <hi>Free-womans</hi> is to <hi>continue.</hi>

                  <p>Now for the clearing our way into this <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,</hi> or <hi>diviſion,</hi> take this general and certain rule to ſteere by, <hi>viz. That look whatſoever that is of the Moral Law, or any part thereof which is not now by Jeſus Chriſt brought into the New Covenant, and become a part thereof, all that is a part of the Old, belongs to the Bond-woman, is to be caſt out;</hi> and contrariwiſe, look whatſoever that is, which is now by Jeſus Chriſt brought into the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and become a part of it, that <hi>appertaines</hi> to the <hi>Free-woman,</hi> and wee cannot without offering high indignity to the <hi>bleſſed Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> yea to Jeſus Chriſt himſelf who is Mediator of this <hi>Covenant,</hi> and hath ſealed the whole with his bloud, <hi>caſt that out.</hi>

                  <p>Here then the queſtion will be, and this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, brings us into the light. <hi>What</hi> was that

                  <p>If once we come to ſee what the <hi>Moral Law</hi> by Chriſts <hi>tranſplanting</hi> of it hath <hi>loſt,</hi> or on the contrary <hi>still retaines,</hi> or hath <hi>gained,</hi> wee ſhall therewith ſee what we are to <hi>diſowne and caſt out,</hi> and what to <hi>love, cheriſh,</hi> and <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</hi>

                  <p>To ſolve this Queſtion, I ſhall take a more particular view of the <hi>Moral Law</hi> in the <hi>three parts</hi> thereof, as it is a commanding Law, a threatning Law, a promiſing Law, and give out of each <hi>Hagar</hi> the Bond-woman her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Sarah</hi> the Free-woman hers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For the <hi>Mandatory part;</hi> The <hi>Moral Law</hi> as the ſame is <hi>Hagars</hi> Law, or the <hi>Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> from Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> had commands, but theſe <hi>commands</hi> were barely a <hi>voyce of words</hi> without power, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.29. a <hi>bare letter</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. but now as the ſame is <hi>Sarahs</hi> Law, or the <hi>New Covenant</hi> given from Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> ſo it hath <hi>commands</hi> too, but they are of another nature, ſuch <hi>command,</hi> as have <hi>efficacy, power,</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> going along with them, for the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> adminiſtration is a miniſtration of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.8. which giveth <hi>life</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to thoſe under it, <hi>vers.</hi> 6.

                  <p>Hence note by the way (as a thing worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation) that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> is <hi>not rejected</hi> for <hi>deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> his <hi>Birth-right,</hi> as <hi>Eſau</hi> afterwards, becauſe <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was borne of the <hi>Bond-woman,</hi> who had <hi>no abſolute right,</hi> and could therefore convey <hi>none</hi> to her <hi>seed,</hi> but <hi>Esau</hi> of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> who was a <hi>Free-woman,</hi> had a <hi>right</hi> to convey, which <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau</hi> deſpiſeth.</p>

                  <p>By what wee have ſaid it is now clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that the <hi>Moral Law</hi> as it is <hi>Sarahs</hi> Law, the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant;</hi> ſo it is not to bee

                  </p>
                  <p>From this <hi>double conſideration</hi> of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> as it is the Law of <hi>Hagar,</hi> the <hi>Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and as it is the Law of <hi>Sarah,</hi> the <hi>New,</hi> ſeveral uſeful <hi>leſſons</hi> doe ariſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Hence, <hi>we may learne how to reconcile ſuch Scriptures as ſeeme to have oppoſition and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in them about the Law,</hi> as namely, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. where the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Wee are dead to the Law,</hi> and verſ. 6. <hi>delivered from the Law,</hi> yet ſaith verſ. 12. <hi>The Commardement is holy, juſt, and good,</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>The Law is ſpiritual,</hi> verſ, 16. <hi>I conſent</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the Law, that it is good,</hi> vers. 22. <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inner man,</hi> verſ. 25. <hi>with my minde I my ſelfe ſerve the Law of God.</hi> How may we <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile</hi> theſe, doth not the Apoſtle ſpeak <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions?</hi> Not ſo, for in verſes 4.6. hee treats of the Law as it is the Law of <hi>Hagar,</hi> the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> and ſo he ſaith, we are <hi>dead</hi> to it, <hi>delivered</hi> from it; in the following verſes he treats of the Law as it is the Law of <hi>Sarah,</hi> or of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> and ſo hee calls it <hi>ſpiritual, holy, juſt,</hi> and <hi>good, conſents</hi> to it, <hi>delights</hi> in it, <hi>ſerves</hi> it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19. <hi>I through the law am dead to the law,</hi> i.e. the <hi>Law</hi> hath ſet mee <hi>wholly free</hi> from the <hi>Law;</hi> Is not this a <hi>contradiction;</hi> No,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:115823:212"/>for the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the <hi>Law</hi> under its <hi>two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold conſideration,</hi> as it is the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>old Covenant,</hi> and as the Law of the <hi>New,</hi> and ſo his meaning is this, I through the Law, through receiving, embracing, or having to doe with the Law, as it is the Law of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> am <hi>dead</hi> to the Law; that is, am ſet <hi>wholly free</hi> from the Law, and have nothing to doe with it as it is the Law of the <hi>Old.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the like interpretation are thoſe words, Rom. 8.2. <hi>For the Law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus hath made me free from the law of ſin and death,</hi> i.e. By the Law of the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> or the Law as it is the Law of the <hi>New Covenant</hi> (which the Apoſtle calls the <hi>Law</hi> of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, becauſe the New Covenant-miniſtration is a miniſtration of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> a miniſtration that giveth life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.8. and hath Chriſt for the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. chap. 9.15. chap. 12.24. and the Bloud of Chriſt as the ſeal or ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.16, 17, 18.)

Hence the diſcovery of <hi>ſin</hi> which is by the <hi>Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> not killing ſin, but rather making it to increaſe, it conſequently <hi>kills</hi> the ſoul, and ſo it becomes a Commandement unto deaths, <hi>a law of death,</hi> a miniſtration of death, 2 <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> 3 7.</p>

                  <p>So alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Beleevers, ſaith, <hi>We are not under the law, but under grace;</hi> yet, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.21. ſpeaking of himſelfe who was a Beleever, he ſaith, <hi>he was under the Law to Chriſt;</hi> Are not theſe <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction?</hi> No, becauſe in the firſt place, the <hi>law</hi> is ſpoken of as it is the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> adminiſtred by <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſo Beleevers in Goſpel-times are not under it; in the latter, the <hi>Law</hi> is ſpoken of, as it is the Law of the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> adminiſtred by the Lord Jeſus; so <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, and all Beleevers who are willingly ſubject to Chriſt, <hi>are</hi> alſo willingly ſubject to his Law.</p>

                  <p>Thus we ſee, how this <hi>diſtinction</hi> about the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> both doth, and will bring all thoſe <hi>oppoſite Scriptures</hi> which concern the Law, to a ſweet <hi>concord</hi> and <hi>harmony</hi> one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Hence wee may learne, <hi>That the Moral Law doth ſtill remaine as a rule to Saints even in Goſpel-times;</hi> for mark it, the <hi>Moral Law</hi> is <hi>Sarahs</hi> Rule as well as <hi>Hagars,</hi> now though <hi>Hagar</hi> the Servant, in Goſpel-times is <hi>an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt,</hi> yet <hi>Sarah</hi> the <hi>Miſtris</hi> ſtill remaines in the Family, and governes there.

But the firſt is true, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, Till heaven and earth paſſe, one jot, or one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſſe from the law, till all bee fulfilled.</hi> As long as <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>earth</hi> remain, ſo long doth the Law remain, and the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of it remain. The word here rendred <hi>fulfilling,</hi> ſignifies a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming or doing, and ſo it doth not reſpect a <hi>doctrinal fulfilling,</hi> as doth the word tranſlated <hi>fulfil</hi> in the former Argument, but a <hi>practical.</hi> Now the Law <hi>practically</hi> is fulfilled, 1. In <hi>Chriſt</hi> as head and common perſon of this Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; this fulfilling had its perfect accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when Chriſt was here on earth. 2 In the <hi>Saints</hi> which are his members: This becauſe it is <hi>imperfect</hi> and wrought by degrees, goes perpetually on, increaſing till wee come to bee wholly like our Head: And this latter I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to bee that which ſhall remaine as long as heaven and earth remaines, the meaning whereof is, <hi>Saints</hi> ſhall daily go on fulfilling of the Law till in the end their obedience come to bee <hi>perfect</hi> as Chriſts was.</p>

As upon the <hi>tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> out of the hands of the <hi>Typical High Prieſts</hi> into the hands of Chriſt the <hi>true High Prieſt,</hi> there is made of <hi>neceſſity</hi> (as the Apoſtle argues, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12.) a <hi>change</hi> or <hi>tranſlation</hi> alſo of the Law: So may I ſay, upon the <hi>tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Scepter</hi> out of the hands of thoſe Kings and Governours of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which were onely <hi>typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal of Chriſt,</hi> into the hands of Chriſt, the <hi>great King</hi> of Saints and Nations, there is made of <hi>neceſſity</hi> a <hi>tranſlation</hi> alſo of the Law, for hee being a King, hee muſt have a Law to <hi>rule</hi> by.

If Saints in <hi>Goſpel-times</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in an eſpecial manner to <hi>remember the Moral law,</hi> then is it a rule to ſuch in <hi>Goſpel-times.</hi> But the antecedent is true, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.4. why after the riſing of the Sun of righteouſneſs, and Saints thriving and flouriſhing under his bright and warme beams, are wee commanded to <hi>remember the law of Moſes?</hi> but to ſhew that that very ſame <hi>Moral law</hi> which was once given forth by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was to remain a rule to Saints even in the <hi>pureſt</hi> and brighteſt <hi>Goſpel-times.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it follows, that by <hi>aboliſhing</hi> the <hi>Moral law</hi> as <hi>Hagars rule,</hi> the rule of the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> we have not <hi>aboliſhed</hi> it as a rule, nor loſt any <hi>iota</hi> of the <hi>ſubstance</hi> of the <hi>Moral law,</hi> but rather <hi>confirmed</hi> the whole in <hi>Sarahs</hi> (the <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi>) hands.</p>
                  <p>In a word, the ſumme of my Diſcourſe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto about the <hi>Moral law,</hi> amounts to this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Moral law</hi> is now by Chriſt the great King and Law-giver of his people <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted</hi> from a more <hi>barren,</hi> into a more <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoyle;</hi> from an <hi>Old Covenant</hi> into a <hi>New</hi> and <hi>better Covenant,</hi> which <hi>Covenant</hi> becauſe it is <hi>everlaſting,</hi> therefor the Law being now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is become <hi>permanent</hi> and <hi>everlaſting</hi> alſo. Yea to the end that the Law might be <hi>ſtable</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever, it was therefore <hi>neceſſary</hi> it ſhould bee <hi>tranſplanted</hi> hither, the <hi>Covenant</hi> in which

So that wee may truly ſay with the Apoſtle: <hi>Do wee make void the Law through faith, God for bid, nay we eſtabliſh the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 Hence wee may learn, <hi>That the very ſame worke or duty for the ſubſtance or matter of it done by one, may bee a Legal worke, done by another; an Evangelical.</hi> The difference betwixt <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Evangelical works,</hi> is not a <hi>material,</hi> but a <hi>formal</hi> difference, <hi>Hagars</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren keep the ſame Law, and do the ſame works for <hi>ſubſtance</hi> that <hi>Sarahs</hi> do. <hi>Hagar</hi> holds forth the <hi>Moral law</hi> to her children, and ſaith, this is my rule, obey it: <hi>Sarah</hi> likewiſe holds it forth to her children, ſaying, And this is my rule, obey it. So that there is <hi>no difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Hagar,</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> as to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> or matter of that <hi>rule</hi> they walk by; for both have materially one and the ſame <hi>rule</hi> propoſed to them, and both ſtrive and indeavor a <hi>conformity</hi> to that rule yet the action of the one is but a <hi>Legal worke,</hi> the action of the other an <hi>Evangelical.</hi> The reaſon of this <hi>difference</hi> lyes in what hath been formerly ſaid, <hi>Hagar</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth her rule to thoſe that are her <hi>ſeed,</hi> as a <hi>bare rule,</hi> telling them onely what is their duty, and preſſing them to the doing hereof by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Threats on the one hand, in caſe they bee found defective but in a tittle, and alluring promiſes of reward on the other, in caſe they prove obedient in all things to her commands, but gives them <hi>no ſtrength</hi> to walk up to that <hi>rule,</hi> ſo as that they may either eſcape the evill
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:115823:217"/>of the threat, or obtaine the good of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Hence <hi>Hagars</hi> Children, in caſe they could perfectly obey, yet their obedience could bee no more but a <hi>pure legal obedience,</hi> that is, obedience ſpringing from themſelves as the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> and motive, terminating in themſelves as their <hi>ultimate end,</hi> or to ſpeak more plainly, obedience done in and by their <hi>owne ſtrength,</hi> to and for their <hi>owne benefit,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to avoyd ſome evil feared, or procure ſome good deſired, which is properly <hi>pure le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal obedience,</hi> when what a man doth, hee doth by himſelf, and to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But now <hi>Sarah,</hi> though ſhee propoſe the <hi>ſame rule</hi> to her <hi>ſeed,</hi> yet in a <hi>different way,</hi> or manner, for together with the <hi>rule</hi> ſhee giveth to her <hi>Children ſtrength</hi> to keep it, cutting off withall from this <hi>rule</hi> the <hi>threat</hi> of death in caſe of diſobedience, and the <hi>promiſe</hi> of life upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of obedience, by <hi>aſſuring</hi> her <hi>ſeed</hi> (in giving forth this <hi>rule</hi> unto them) that they are already moſt <hi>certainly freed</hi> from death, and <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> of life, and that therefore ſhee gives not forth this <hi>rule</hi> unto them, to bee as <hi>a way</hi> or meanes, through the obſervance of which they may <hi>eſcape</hi> the one, or <hi>obtaine</hi> the other, but only as a <hi>declaration</hi> of their <hi>Fathers will,</hi> and their <hi>duty,</hi> that by it they may bee inſtructed how they ought to walk, and to pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p>Hence the <hi>obedience</hi> of <hi>Sarahs</hi> Children (ſo farre as they are ſubject to their Mother <hi>Sarah</hi> only, receiving their <hi>Law</hi> out of her hand) is <hi>pure Goſpel obedience,</hi> i. e. obedience ſpringing from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt dwelling in them as the <hi>principal efficient cauſe,</hi> from love and
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:115823:218"/>thankfulneſs to-their <hi>Father</hi> as the <hi>moving cauſe,</hi> from an <hi>earneſt deſire</hi> that their <hi>Father</hi> might have <hi>ſome ſervice</hi> from them, and <hi>glory</hi> by them as the <hi>final cauſe,</hi> and this is <hi>pure Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel obedience,</hi> when God is <hi>Agent, Motive,</hi> and <hi>End</hi> in all we doe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Hence wee may learn, <hi>That a true Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as he doth not expect life and ſalvation from his obedience to the Law, ſo ſhould hee not fear death and condemnation, either by his falling ſhort in obedience, or by his diſobedience.</hi> This <hi>Poſition</hi> will ſound harſh in ſome cares, and be accounted a leavened Principle, but doe but obſerve how <hi>naturally</hi> it flowes from what hath been laid downe and proved; for if the <hi>promiſe</hi> of life and ſalvation upon <hi>condition</hi> of obedience, and the <hi>threat</hi> of Death and Condemnation to the diſobedient, bee <hi>proper</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> as <hi>Hagars</hi> Law, and if the Law, as <hi>Hagars</hi> Law, be now <hi>caſt out,</hi> then hath a Beleever <hi>nothing to doe</hi> with the Law, as it is a <hi>law promiſing</hi> life to the obedient, or <hi>threatning</hi> death to the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and if ſo, then cannot he <hi>expect life and ſalvation</hi> from it, though hee ſhould obey it; nor need hee <hi>fear death</hi> though hee diſobey it.

                  <p>The final Concluſion is, <hi>That the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence 1 Learn, <hi>That it is not ſafe for us to take up principles meerly from men, though ever ſo good men and able.</hi> It any one <hi>principle,</hi> that yet will not ſtand with the truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may plead the <hi>number and worth</hi> of its Patrons and Friends, this may. Let us learn to give honour to whom honour is due, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and reſpect to holy men, and to their holineſs ſo far as the ſame is due, but let the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or holineſs of no man, or men, bee the <hi>ſtandard</hi> of our principles, for it is not any thing within, but the bleſſed word without that is the onely ſure foundation to truth, bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome to our faith. <hi>Paul</hi> commended the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> for not taking up what hee delivered upon truſt, but ſearching the Scriptures, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the things were ſo, or not, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.10, 11. How would ſuch a ſpirit grace the <hi>Miniſtry at this day? And how much cauſe have wee to lament the want of it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Hence, learn, <hi>That juſtification, peace of conſcience here, ſalvation hereafter, is not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the</hi> Old Covenant. The reaſon is, becauſe all theſe flow from grace, 1 <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> flows from grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.7. 2 <hi>Peace of conſcience</hi> flows from that, and therefore conſequently from <hi>grace,</hi> Rom. 5.1, 2, 3.

But now the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> is not a <hi>Covenant of grace;</hi> Therefore neither of theſe which
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:115823:225"/>are all <hi>effects of grace,</hi> are <hi>attainable</hi> by it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Hence, Learn, <hi>That whatſoever worke may bee in a man, or upon him, by vertue of the Old Covenant, and the power that it hath ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is not a worke of grace.</hi> A man under the Old Covenant may through the terrors of it upon his conſcience do much, hee may <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> as <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> did; <hi>confeſſe</hi> his ſin to others as <hi>Saul</hi> did to <hi>David, pray and deny</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.17.

I ſay, hee may bee outwardly <hi>very ſtrict,</hi> yet not have <hi>one dram of grace,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> is not a Covenant that <hi>gives grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence, wee may ſee what a <hi>great Miſtake</hi> many poor ſouls lye under, about their <hi>own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and the <hi>condition</hi> of others, whilſt they bleſſe themſelves, or others, as being the <hi>people of God,</hi> becauſe ſome <hi>Legal works</hi> through the <hi>terrors</hi> of the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> have paſſed upon them, they have <hi>repented</hi> and <hi>mourned,</hi> and been, <hi>humbled,</hi> and are <hi>reformed,</hi> &amp;c. Truly all this a man may bee, and yet (as Chriſt ſaith) a Publican and Harlot may <hi>get into heaven</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. <hi>All this,</hi> if there bee no more doth not <hi>evidence</hi> a dram of <hi>grace,</hi> for all this may bee by the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> which is not a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace,</hi> nor doth convey grace.

Now many when they feel an <hi>Old Covenant</hi> work paſſed upon them, or ſee it in others (which men may have, and drop into hell notwithſtanding, yea thouſands are there which have had it) they preſently cry out, Well I am a Saint, a <hi>childe of God,</hi> ſuch a one is a <hi>childe of God,</hi> my <hi>condition,</hi> and his, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>good,</hi> wee are happy men, &amp;c. when as alas poor ſouls they are <hi>meerly deluded,</hi> they feed on aſhes, a deceived heart hath turned them aſide, and though now they will not beleeve it, becauſe they are loath to bee troubled, by thinking otherwiſe of themſelves then that all is well, and alſo becauſe others think well of them; and ſo as the ſtony ground they have their root not in themſelves, but in another, <hi>i. e.</hi> the root of their comfort is laid in anothers judgement of their condition, and the good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion another hath of them, yet the day will come, when to their <hi>woe,</hi> they will find it, namely in that day when many ſhall come and ſay, Lord, Lord, have not we done thus and thus, been thus and thus, and ſhal receive this anſwer, contrary to their expectation, <hi>Depart from mee, I know yee not, yee workers of iniquity;</hi> Come yee to mee (will Chriſt then ſay) with your <hi>works,</hi> you have done thus and thus, away with <hi>you,</hi> and your <hi>works</hi> too, for I account no better of your <hi>works</hi> than as they are, <hi>works of iniquity,</hi> nor of <hi>you</hi> any better for them, then as you are, a company of <hi>workers of iniquity.</hi> When this day comes
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:115823:226"/>mens eyes will be open, and they will finde that truth which now they will not beleeve; then ſhal the <hi>children</hi> of the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> when they come upon this ſtage be known from the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> of the <hi>New.</hi> Here will bee the ſeparation indeed betwixt the <hi>Goats</hi> and the <hi>Sheep,</hi> but of theſe things more hereafter.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 <hi>MORE GENERALLY;</hi> a reſemblance there was in this Old Covenant of that <hi>great gift and bleſſing</hi> of the New Covenant (which is incluſive of all other gifts and bleſſings) <hi>viz.</hi> Gods <hi>Donation of himſelf</hi> to a people.

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:115823:231"/>this Old Covenant <hi>gives himſelfe</hi> in an outward and conditional way to Iſrael, with whom hee made this <hi>Covenant.</hi> And this <hi>outward gift</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelfe to the <hi>whole Trinity,</hi> Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>

<pb n="432" facs="tcp:115823:232"/>may turn againſt us, and bee our Enemy to morrow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The <hi>Son</hi> is likewiſe <hi>given</hi> to them to bee their <hi>Redeemer</hi> in a way of <hi>outward Redemption.</hi> This outward Redemption which they by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Old Covenant were made partakers of, was no other but a Redemption from <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward evils,</hi> from the outward part of that <hi>curſe</hi> which the Old Covenant did inflict on thoſe that brake it. This <hi>Redemption</hi> they had by the blood or their Sacrifices, which Sacrifices of theirs, were no other but a ſhadow of Chriſt his Sacrifice (that in the fulneſs of time was to bee offered) and that Redemption that was to come by him. This <hi>outward Redemption</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Preface to the Ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by <hi>Redemption</hi> from Egyptian bondage, which <hi>Redemption</hi> was outward, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2. <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage.</hi> This Redemption many had who yet were no whit benefited by it, as thoſe that came out of Egypt, afterwards periſhed in the wilderneſſe, <hi>Jude</hi> 5. and thoſe that had been delivered, God ſaith of them that hee would deliver them <hi>no more,</hi> Judges 5.8. Many by the blood of their Sacrifices were ſo far purged, as that the <hi>outward puniſhment</hi> of their ſin was remitted, who yet notwithſtanding had the guilt of their ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining upon them, and did in the end <hi>dye</hi> and <hi>periſh</hi> in their ſins. This is the <hi>Redemption</hi> we read of <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Though I have redeemed them, yet they have ſpoken lyes againſt mee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 The <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>given</hi> to them to be their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:115823:232"/>or Leader. This I take it, is meant by <hi>Gods preſence,</hi> Exod. 33.14. which is called the <hi>Angel of his preſence,</hi> Iſa. 63.9. which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling againſt, are ſaid to rebel againſt, and vexe his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> verſ. 10. holding forth thus much, That we are not by the <hi>Angel of his preſence,</hi> to underſtand the <hi>Son</hi> (who is ſet forth unto us by, and under thoſe other expreſſions, verſ. 8, 9. <hi>He was their Saviour. In all their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction hee was afflicted, in his love and pity hee redeemed, them, &amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>Angel of his preſence</hi> is clearly ſpoken of, as diſtinct from him) but the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> which ſo long as they did obey, ſaved them, was a <hi>ſafe Leader,</hi> Conductor to them, but ſo ſoon as they did rebel, became <hi>their enemy,</hi> and fought againſt them. So that in this Old Covenant the Spirit was given forth to bee a Conductor, Leader, &amp;c. But this <hi>gift</hi> of the Spirit was but <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>conditional,</hi> ſo long as they did perform the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they had this outward preſence and tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, but breaking the condition, their Guardian turned againſt them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their Enemy. And therefore as God doth aſſure <hi>Zerubbabel, Joſhua, &amp;c.</hi> when they fell to their duty, and were obedient, that his <hi>Spirit</hi> according to the word hee Covenanted with them when they came out of Egypt, did remain among them, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.5. So on the other ſide, the Rebels (but now mentioned) which for a time had the tuition of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> by their rebellion loſt it, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> their Guide and Protector, becomes <hi>their Enemy,</hi> Iſaiah 63.9, 10.</p>
                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:115823:233"/>
                  <p>Thus the gift of the Father, of the Son' and of the Spirit, which are the great gift, and principal bleſſing of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> were given in an outward and conditional way even by the <hi>Old Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 And MORE PARTICULARLY; a reſemblance there was in this <hi>Old Covenant</hi> of ELECTION, which lay in that outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> Gods picking, chuſing, ſelecting of that Nation (which choyſe included particular perſons alſo as members of the body) to bee a <hi>peculiar people</hi> to himſelf, in ſuch ſort as no other Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, nor any particular perſons in, and of other Nations (confidered as ſuch) were, or could bee the people of God.

Hence God is ſaid to chuſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 20.5. and <hi>Iſrael</hi> is called <hi>his choſen,</hi> Pſal. 105.6. hence alſo this people are called a <hi>peculiar treaſure,</hi> Exod. 19.5. a <hi>peculiar people,</hi> Deut. 14.2.26.18. a people of <hi>inheritance to him,</hi> Deut. 4.20. a people <hi>eſtabliſhed to himſelf,</hi> Deut. 29.13. yet ſuch was this election, as that in caſe die con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by which it was given were not by them obſerved, it preſently <hi>became voyd,</hi> and was as if there neither were, nor ever had been any ſuch thing at all, therefore when <hi>Iſrael</hi> caſt off God, and choſe new gods, God preſently caſts off them, will not owne them as his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, deliver them any more, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.8. <hi>They choſe new gods, then was warre in the gates;</hi>

<pb n="437" facs="tcp:115823:234"/>Hence the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> quoting theſe words of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Heb. 8.9. for thoſe words, <hi>although I was an Huſband to them</hi> (which hee leaves out) puts in theſe, <hi>and I regarded them not, ſaith the Lord;</hi> intimating, that although God was a <hi>Husband</hi> in this <hi>Covenant,</hi> yet ſuch a Husband as would no longer regard them then they kept Covenant with him, they muſt look for no <hi>conjugal love,</hi> no embraces, no communion with God as a Husband, any longer then they <hi>kept themſelves</hi> chaſte Spouſes.

                  <p n="2">2 For Ordinances, the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> (as I have ſaid) had Ordinances in it; now much <hi>faith</hi> was by many repoſed in theſe.

But yet, this confidence was but a lying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and therefore ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Truſt not in lying words, ſaying, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and further tells them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. that they ſhould not have this truſt long, for the Temple wherein they did ſo much truſt, God would deſtroy, and where then would their truſt be?</p>
                  <p>This <hi>truſt in Ordinances</hi> was ſo great, as that they did under it ſhrowd themſelves in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Micha</hi> 3.9, 10, 11. They commit all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of iniquity, and yet leane upon the Lord, truſt in him, conclude for certaine hee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, no <hi>evil</hi> ſhould befall them; What makes them conclude thus?

                  </p>
                  <p>Memorable is that of <hi>Abijah,</hi> 2 Chron. 13. whoſe <hi>faith</hi> riſeth very high, verſ. 12. <hi>Behold God himſelf is with us for our Captain, O children of Iſrael, fight yee not againſt the Lord God of your Fathers, for you ſhall not proſper.</hi> And by this <hi>faith</hi> a moſt glorious victory is obtained, verſ. 18. <hi>Thus the children of Iſrael were brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the children of Judah prevailed, becauſe they relied upon the Lord God of their Fathers.</hi> But what was this <hi>faith</hi> built upon, why in
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:115823:238"/>great part (though not wholly) upon <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> as ſee verſ. 10, 11. <hi>But as for us the Lord is our God, and we have not forſaken him, and the Prieſts which miniſter unto the Lord are the ſons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their buſineſſe: And they burn unto the Lord every morning, and every evening burnt Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and ſweet Incenſe, the Shew-bread alſo they ſet in order upon the pure Table, and the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke of gold with the Lamps thereof, to burn e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very evening; for we keep the charge of the Lord our God.</hi> Obedience to the Commands and Inſtitutions of the Lord, and the preſence and injoyment of Ordinances, are two principal things upon which theſe high expreſſions of <hi>faith</hi> are grounded. And obſerve notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the faith of this King did riſe to ſo great a height, yet was it not a true faith? for of the ſame perſon it is ſaid, 1 King. 15.3. <hi>That he walked in all the ſins of his Father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as the heart of</hi> David <hi>his Father.</hi> So that there may be great faith ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Duties, injoyment of Ordinances, which yet notwithſtanding is not true faith, it is the faith of the Old Covenant, but not the faith of the New.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 For <hi>Outward priviledges,</hi> what confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence did the Jews lay in this external privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of being <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.33. yet <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> tells them plainly, that the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their <hi>faith</hi> was an <hi>empty thing,</hi> and would prove but a lying vanity, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Thinke not to ſay within your ſelves we have

                  <p>Notable is that place, Iſa. 48.1, 2. <hi>Hear yee this, O houſe of Jacob, which are called by the name of Iſrael, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which ſwear by the Name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Iſrael, but not in truth, nor in righteouſneſs.

                  <p>The <hi>Condition required</hi> for the attaining and keeping of theſe, was a diligent obſervance of what things the <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Judicial</hi> Lawes, conſidered onely according to the Letter, did require. If they did what in the Letter of theſe Laws was commanded, as in caſe they ſet up no other gods in their Land, made no graven Images to worſhip, did not take Gods Name in vain, nor prophane his Sabbath, nor behave themſelves diſobediently towards their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, nor were guilty of the acts of Murder. Adultery, Theft, &amp;c. And ſo alſo for the <hi>Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als;</hi> by this Litteral obedience they came to have a right to all thoſe <hi>bleſsings</hi> and <hi>mercies</hi> (whether more common or ſpecial) which were but <hi>meerly outward</hi> and <hi>temporary;</hi> that is to ſay, They ſhould in doing theſe punctually and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, as was required in the Letter of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, bee bleſſed with long life in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> multiplication of their Nation, advancement of them above other Nations, have bleſſings attending them in City, Field, fruit of their bodies, ground, cattel, in their basket, ſtore, in their out-goings, in-comings, in their Store-houſes, and all they ſhould ſet
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:115823:240"/>their hands unto, have the victory and rule over their enemies, bee freed from ſickneſſes, diſeaſes, Famine, Captivity, &amp;c. Alſo they ſhould ſo doing, bee Gods peculiar people, and hee would bee their God, a Father, Husband to them, make them a holy Nation to himſelfes crown them with peculiar dignity, honor, &amp;c. To the attainment of all theſe things, a <hi>bare, litteral obedience</hi> was ſufficient, and obedience of this <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> was <hi>true obedience</hi> to the Old Covenant, ſo farre as the ſame was a Covenant, giving and diſpenſing <hi>Outward mercies,</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> onely.</p>
                  <p>And indeed that ſuch an <hi>obedience</hi> there was is clear, becauſe as outward mercies of peace, plenty, &amp;c. were promiſed to Iſrael upon <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of their obedience, ſo were theſe mercies oft-times enjoyed by them. But now ſhould wee conceive a <hi>ſpiritual obedience</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> to bee the condition upon which theſe were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, then becauſe obedience of this nature they were never able to give, it would have been impoſſible for them to have injoyed theſe at any time. Such therefore muſt the condition bee for outward mercies as they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, which performing they had, and did keep their mercies, and not performing, did loſe them, and come under a <hi>curſe,</hi> unleſſe they did immediately upon every act of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion (which it were a thing impoſſible for them to do, had the Condition I ſay, been <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual obedience,</hi> in which acts of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are multiplied hourly) flye for reliefe to the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> their City of refuge.</p>
                  <pb n="450" facs="tcp:115823:241"/>
                  <p>And becauſe there was <hi>ſuch an obedience</hi> as this required in the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> upon the due performance of which, men might even upon the termes of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> lay claim to outward mercies, therefore I take it, doth holy <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (hee having kept the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> according to the Letter thereof) when he was to plead for an <hi>outward mercy,</hi> viz. continuance of life, urge <hi>his obedience,</hi> Iſa. 38.3. As alſo good <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> ſpreads his <hi>obedience</hi> before God, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.14.</p>
                  <p>And this <hi>obedience</hi> (I conceive) the young man meant and no other, when hee ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>All theſe have I kept from my youth,</hi> for had hee looked upon the Law in the <hi>ſpirituality</hi> of it, neither hee, nor any man living could ever make ſuch a boaſt.</p>
                  <p>This likewiſe was the <hi>obedience Paul</hi> had in his eyes when hee ſaith of himſelf, before his converſion, that hee was <hi>as touching the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law, blameleſſe,</hi> Phil. 3.6.</p>
                  <p>The opinion therefore of the Jews, that <hi>outward literal obedience</hi> was true <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> was not falſe, onely it was ſhort; it was <hi>true obedience</hi> as to the attaining <hi>outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,</hi> only it was not the <hi>all of obedience</hi> the <hi>Law required.</hi> And therefore Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. where his large diſcourſe upon the <hi>Law</hi> by way of expoſition of it was dawn forth by the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes abuſe of this <hi>opinion,</hi> doth not in the leaſt condemn the <hi>opinion</hi> it ſelfe of <hi>litteral obedience,</hi> as if there were no ſuch <hi>kinde of obedience</hi> at all, ſufficient for the attainment of any thing, but only condemns their abuſe of it, and that
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:115823:241"/>improvement they made of this, <hi>viz.</hi> That a man might enter into the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and bee ſaved by it, this hee ſhews could not bee but in caſe they ſought ſalvation from the <hi>Law,</hi> another <hi>kinde of obedience</hi> than this muſt bee given to it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Old Covenant</hi> had as well <hi>bleſſings ſpiritual and eternal,</hi> as <hi>outward</hi> or <hi>temporary;</hi> but yet ſo, as that theſe were not (as the former) <hi>attainable</hi> by this <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> as I ſhall ſhew preſently.</p>
                  <p>Now that the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> had a <hi>Spiritual and eternal bleſſing</hi> held forth in it, is manifeſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 From the <hi>contrary,</hi> viz. <hi>a curſe of eternal death</hi> coming in upon the <hi>breach</hi> of it, Gal. 3.10. It is obſervable (as I have formerly noted) that theſe words relate to <hi>Moſes his Covenant,</hi> and are therefore quoted thence; now if <hi>Moſes Covenant</hi> did hold forth <hi>death eternal</hi> to the <hi>breakers</hi> of it, then muſt wee alſo ſuppoſe on the contrary <hi>life eternal</hi> to bee held forth to him, or them that ſhould keep it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That <hi>oppoſition</hi> betwixt the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>Old,</hi> and <hi>New Covenant,</hi> which the Apoſtle in his Sermons &amp; Writings, eſpecially in the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> &amp; <hi>Galatians</hi> doth ſpeak ſo much of, plainly declares this; for wherein lyes this <hi>oppoſition,</hi> but herein, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the <hi>one,</hi> life, juſtification, ſalvation is held forth <hi>upon condition,</hi> in the <hi>other</hi> freely and abſolutely. Herein I ſay lyes the oppoſition, that the very ſame bleſſing is held forth in one, <hi>one way,</hi> in the other, <hi>another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that the <hi>Law</hi> which the Apoſtle in his
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:115823:242"/>Epiſtles doth ſet in oppoſition to the Goſpel, is to bee underſtood of <hi>Moſes his Law,</hi> and not the Covenant of works made with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, is clear, becauſe hee quotes (as I have ſaid) the very words of <hi>Moſes curſe,</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Law</hi> which was four hundred and thirty years after the <hi>promiſe</hi> made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was given upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> which was the <hi>School-maſter,</hi> Tutor, and Governour of Gods people under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> that <hi>Law</hi> which the falſe Apoſtles did teach and cry up, which was not <hi>Adams Covenant,</hi> but the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> made by <hi>Moſes;</hi> all clearly ſhewing that the <hi>Law</hi> ſtanding in <hi>oppoſite termes</hi> to the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was (according to the minde of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes;</hi> if ſo, then the <hi>ground</hi> of the oppoſition betwixt them lying in this, that the <hi>Law</hi> gave life and ſalvation <hi>upon condition,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel freely,</hi> it doth <hi>neceſſarily</hi> (unleſſe wee deſtroy the <hi>oppoſition</hi> it ſelf, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the <hi>ground</hi> of if) follow, That <hi>Moſes his Law</hi> did hold forth life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The manifold <hi>Scripture-phraſes and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi> (eſpecially in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi>) which hold forth <hi>life</hi> in, and by doing, confirm this; as,</p>
                  <p>Matth. 19.16, 17. <hi>Maſter, what good thing ſhall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?</hi> Note, the Queſtion is about <hi>eternal life.</hi> What is Chriſts anſwer? Why, <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandements.</hi> Now if the <hi>Law</hi> did not hold forth ſuch a thing as <hi>eternal life</hi> to thoſe that ſhould keep it, men ſhould the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:115823:242"/>of Chriſt bee falſe, for the matter of it.</p>
                  <p>Now although it is true, Chriſt had it in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to convince the young man, and to make him ſee that indeed hee neither had, nor could keep the Commandements though hee boaſted of it; yet muſt wee not thinke, that Chriſt to doe this, did uſe indirect meanes, ſpeake that which for the very matter of it was falſe, to convince him of that, which was a truth.</p>
                  <p>Rom. 2.13. <hi>For not the hearers of the Law are juſt before God, but the doers of the Law, ſhall bee juſtified;</hi> importing plainly, that the Law can, and doth give forth <hi>juſtification</hi> to him whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it bee that gives it its condition of doing, <hi>viz. perfect obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Rom. 7.10. <hi>The Commandement which was ordained to life, I found to bee unto death.</hi> It is clear the Apoſtle doth here ſpeak of <hi>Moſes Law</hi> throughout the Chapter, and hee ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, it was to <hi>life,</hi> ordained, inſtituted to <hi>life,</hi> which fully, and in termes ſpeaks the thing aſſerted.</p>
                  <p>Rom. 10.5. <hi>For Moſes deſcribeth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe which is of the Law, that the man which doth thoſe things ſhall live by them.</hi> It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the words of the Apoſtle, that <hi>Moſes Covenant</hi> is here ſpoken of, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from his ſcope (hee being treating of <hi>Juſtification</hi>) that the <hi>life</hi> mentioned is <hi>life eternal,</hi> which two things make good our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</p>
                  <p>Gal. 3.12. <hi>The Law is not of faith, but the
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:115823:243"/>man that doth them, ſhall live in them.</hi> The Law here is the ſame Law with that pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the curſe, verſe 10. and that Law is <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes,</hi> the <hi>life</hi> promiſed is the ſame life with that the juſtified perſon lives, as the connexion of theſe words with the words of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent verſe doth make appeare, and that <hi>life</hi> is <hi>life eternal.</hi> Therefore it neceſſarily follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, or the Old Covenant, doth promiſe lire eternal to the obedient in their obedience; that is, in obeying it perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and eternally, they ſhall have <hi>Eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for this reaſon (as I conceive) doth the Scripture here, and elſe-where uſe this phraſe of <hi>living</hi> in them, not <hi>living</hi> by them, to ſhew that though the Law, or Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant hold forth a bleſſing of-life, yet it holds it forth no longer then they continue in perfect obedience: So long as their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is perfect, <hi>life</hi> is held forth, and given by this Covenant, but whenſoever they faulter, all former obedience is forgotten, and the bleſſing of life preſently removed, and the curſe of death is inflicted, according to that, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To ſay no more, if the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant did not hold forth <hi>bleſsings Spiritual and Eternal,</hi> as well as <hi>outward and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,</hi> how could Chriſts active obedience to the Command of the Law, or Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, have a cauſal influence into our <hi>Juſtification?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:115823:243"/>
                  <p>Chriſt (as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4.) was made of a woman under the Law, or <hi>Old Covenant;</hi> being under it hee did as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon of all his elect, <hi>perfectly obey</hi> it for them, and in their ſtead, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.15. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. By this <hi>obedience</hi> of his they are made righteous. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by the diſobedience of one, many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> i. e. Chriſts active obedience hath a cauſal influence into the juſtification of his ſeed, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> active diſobedience had a cauſal influence into the condemnation of his ſeed, as <hi>Adam</hi> brought guilt upon his ſeed by his diſobedience, ſo Chriſt brings righteouſneſſe upon his ſeed by his obedience. Upon which account, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to every one that beleeveth,</hi> i. e. the very thing which the Law as its end requires, <hi>viz.</hi> perfect obedience for the obtaining of righteouſneſſe or juſtification; Chriſt in the behalf of all his hath given it, and ſo the Law hath its end, <hi>viz. perfect righteouſneſſe</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Chriſt their Surety and common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and by his ſo doing the righteouſneſſe of the Law comes to be fulfilled in them, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. and they come to be <hi>the righteouſneſſe of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſay, in caſe the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> did hold forth no ſuch thing as <hi>life eternal,</hi> how could Chriſts obedience thereto have been <hi>influential</hi> into our <hi>justification,</hi> which yet it is moſt clear it was; could Chriſt by obeying it obtain more from it then it had to give? certainly no, yet
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:115823:244"/>Chriſt by obeying it, did obtaine ſpiritual and eternal bleſſings from it, therefore it muſt needs bee that the Old Covenant hath ſuch to give.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>It will be ſaid, This makes the Law or Old Covenant to be againſt the promiſes which the Apoſtle expreſly diſownes,</hi> Gal. 3.21. <hi>yea makes it to diſanul the promiſe, which hee tells us the Old Covenant cannot doe,</hi> verſ. 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not ſo, ſeeing this <hi>Old Covenant</hi> though it did hold forth life, yet did it not hold it forth to this end to give it, but for other ends, and therefore it holds it forth in ſuch <hi>a way,</hi> and upon ſuch a condition, as that it was a thing impoſſible for any to <hi>have life</hi> by it though they would, but all that would <hi>have life</hi> muſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any help it could afford them, fly to the <hi>promiſe,</hi> or <hi>periſh</hi> forever.</p>
                  <p>Now though it did hold forth <hi>life,</hi> yet ſo long as it gave none, but rather held it forth in ſuch <hi>a way,</hi> as that the <hi>attainment of life</hi> by it was a thing altogether impoſſible. Hence the ordaining of it as a <hi>Covenant for life,</hi> was not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory</hi> to the <hi>promiſe,</hi> nor could the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of it as ſuch <hi>a Covenant,</hi> in the leaſt, <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anul</hi> the fore-going <hi>promiſe;</hi> had indeed <hi>life</hi> been <hi>attaineable</hi> by it, it would have <hi>deſtroyed</hi> the <hi>promiſe,</hi> becauſe then <hi>life</hi> ſhould have been attained in <hi>two diſtinct</hi> and <hi>contrary waies,</hi> of which one muſt <hi>neceſſarily</hi> have <hi>deſtroyed</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But the holding of it forth as a <hi>Covenant for life,</hi> but not to <hi>this end</hi> to <hi>give life,</hi> but for <hi>other ends,</hi> yea in ſuch <hi>a way</hi> too as that it <hi>could not</hi> give life though a man ſhould ſeek it
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:115823:244"/>thereby, was no <hi>contradiction</hi> at all to the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> ſeeing there was ſtill but <hi>one way</hi> for the attaining of life, <hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>promiſe,</hi> whether all that will have <hi>life</hi> muſt <hi>flye,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Old Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore minde it, when the Apoſtle had moved the queſtion, <hi>Is the Law againſt the promiſes?</hi> he doth not in anſwer ſay thus, No, God forbid, for if there had been a <hi>law</hi> ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for <hi>life,</hi> verily <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> ſhould have been by the <hi>Law,</hi> but thus, <hi>if there had been a Law given that could have given life;</hi> hee doth not at all <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> as ordained <hi>to life,</hi> but elſewhere (as I have noted already) expreſly affirmes it to be a truth, but the only thing he <hi>denies</hi> is the <hi>Laws giving of life,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> though ordained <hi>to life</hi> could not <hi>give it,</hi> and upon this very reaſon the Apoſtle proves it not to bee <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> the <hi>promiſes,</hi> becauſe it could not <hi>give life;</hi> if it could have <hi>given life,</hi> it would have <hi>diſanulled</hi> the <hi>promiſe,</hi> but though it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>to life,</hi> yet ſo long as it neither did, nor could <hi>give this life</hi> to any Soul, in was not <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> the <hi>promiſes;</hi> ſo that indeed from the very words of the text rightly opened, all the ſtrength and force of the objection falls of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>From what hath been ſaid it appears, That the <hi>miſtake</hi> of the Scribes, Phariſees, and the generality of the <hi>Jewes</hi> in Chriſts and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times, in the great Article of <hi>Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> had not this for its ground, <hi>viz.</hi> a looking upon <hi>Moſes</hi> Covenant, to be a <hi>Covenant</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:115823:245"/>forth <hi>life eternal,</hi> for that was a truth, and ſo farre they were in the right, but their <hi>miſtake</hi> lay in this, <hi>viz.</hi> A ſuppoſition that <hi>life eternal</hi> was <hi>attaineable</hi> by it, which their unacquainted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with the <hi>condition</hi> of this <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> making it to be <hi>all one,</hi> both in reſpect of <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life,</hi> and <hi>eternal,</hi> (viz. a meer <hi>literal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>) did ruſh them into; they took the <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> in its full and whole extent, as reaching both things <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>eternal,</hi> but the <hi>condition</hi> they halved, taking that part which was moſt eaſie for them to performe, and by ſo doing, made up that moſt falſe and dangerous concluſion, ſo much oppoſed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> viz. That <hi>Juſtification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> was <hi>attaineable</hi> by the <hi>works of the Law.</hi> Had they rightly underſtood <hi>the condition</hi> upon which <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal bleſſings</hi> were given forth, as they did <hi>that condition</hi> which gave them a right to <hi>temporal,</hi> this opinion of <hi>Self-righteouſneſſe</hi> would in them have <hi>dyed</hi> of it ſelf, as it did in <hi>Paul</hi> to ſoon as ever hee came to this underſtanding, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9, 10.</p>

And this Chriſts Expoſition both of the <hi>Law Moral</hi> and <hi>Judicial,</hi> Matth. 5. doth clearly hold forth, for firſt, Chriſt falls upon the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritualizeth</hi> it, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the tranſgreſſion of the <hi>heart</hi> in reſpect of any of the <hi>things commanded</hi> in that <hi>Law,</hi> was as real <hi>a breach</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> as tranſgreſſion in <hi>act.</hi> Then upon the <hi>Judicial Law,</hi> ſhewing, that under thoſe <hi>Judicial Statutes</hi> which were but as the <hi>ſhell,</hi> were contained more <hi>ſpiritual precepts,</hi> which they ſtood as much obliged to (if they would have <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> by the <hi>Law</hi>) as the other.</p>
                  <p>And that this was the <hi>condition</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> for <hi>life eternal,</hi> is clear, becauſe the <hi>Law</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth the <hi>Curſe of death eternal</hi> unto all thoſe that ſhould not continue to doe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was written in the Book of the <hi>Law,</hi> Gal. 3.10. now it was not only written in the Book of the <hi>Law</hi> thus and thus thou ſhalt doe, but alſo (as the fore-quoted Texts doe prove) that thou ſhouldeſt doe thus and thus, keep Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, Statutes, Judgements, with all thy heart, with all thy might, and with all thy ſoul; if therefore a man did according to the <hi>Letter</hi> keep every Command (which was ſufficient to procure <hi>outward mercies,</hi> and avert <hi>outward Judgements</hi>) yet if he did not doe this conſtantly, and that with all his heart, with all his might, and with all his ſoul, (i. e. <hi>perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>) hee could not bee freed from the <hi>curſe of
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:115823:246"/>death eternal,</hi> becauſe (I ſay) ſo much is not done as is <hi>required</hi> in the Book of the <hi>Law.</hi> This <hi>perfect obedience</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> therefore, not only according to the <hi>letter,</hi> but the <hi>ſpiritual mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of it, and perſeverance herein, was the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> upon which the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal Bleſſing</hi> of the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> were given forth.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe <hi>no man living</hi> ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> was <hi>ever able</hi> to give <hi>ſuch obedience</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> as it <hi>requires,</hi> but all have done, and doe offend againſt it <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> in thought, word, and deed. Hence the Apoſtle concludes, <hi>no man</hi> can be <hi>juſtified</hi> by the <hi>works of the law, Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>chap.</hi> 3.11. but rather indeed <hi>all men</hi> are <hi>guilty,</hi> convinced of <hi>ſin,</hi> and caſt by it, and therefore he ſaith, <hi>By the law is the knowledge of ſin, and every mouth by it is ſtopped, and all the world are become guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3.19, 20. yea by the <hi>workes of the law</hi> the <hi>Curſe</hi> is upon <hi>every man</hi> that ſtands <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. and therefore hee calls the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> a <hi>killing letter,</hi> a <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of death,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6, 7. and a <hi>Law of ſin and death,</hi> Rom. 8.2. <hi>i. e.</hi> in ſtead of <hi>juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and giving <hi>eternal life,</hi> it doth no other but <hi>condemn, kill,</hi> and inflict <hi>eternal death</hi> upon thoſe <hi>under</hi> it; which alſo the Apoſtle found true in his owne experience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.10. for which cauſe he affirmes the <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Old Covenant</hi> to be <hi>aboliſhed</hi> for the <hi>weakneſſe</hi> and <hi>unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> thereof, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.18, 19. <hi>i. e.</hi> becauſe it was altogether <hi>unable</hi> to give <hi>eternal life</hi> to any that ſtood <hi>under</hi> it, or to make them <hi>perfect</hi> in the buſineſſe of <hi>Salvation,</hi> and therefore there was
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:115823:246"/>a neceſsity of <hi>aboliſhing</hi> it, and bringing in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof a <hi>better hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet that none in this great buſineſſe may lye under <hi>miſ-apprehenſions,</hi> let it be here conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that this <hi>inability</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> to <hi>give life,</hi> which the Apoſtle makes the reaſon of <hi>abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating</hi> or <hi>diſannulling</hi> therof, did not ariſe from <hi>any weakneſſe</hi> that was in the <hi>law</hi> it ſelf, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the <hi>weakneſſe</hi> of thoſe to whom the <hi>law</hi> was given to performe what it <hi>required.</hi> The <hi>law</hi> conſidered in its ſelf was <hi>throughly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to have <hi>given life,</hi> could they have <hi>obeyed</hi> it, but the <hi>weakneſſe</hi> was in them that could not, by reaſon of the <hi>imperfection</hi> of corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>obey</hi> it, nor give the <hi>law</hi> its owne termes for <hi>life.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. ſaith, that the <hi>law</hi> could not <hi>juſtifie,</hi> give <hi>eternal life, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe it was <hi>weak through the fleſh,</hi> the <hi>weakneſſe</hi> lay not in the <hi>law</hi> it ſelf, but in man through the fall <hi>made weak,</hi> corrupted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, and rendred altogether <hi>unable</hi> to give the <hi>law</hi> its termes; but yet what the <hi>law</hi> could not give to man for himſelf, becauſe hee being a lump of fleſh could not give it its termes, it could and did give to Chriſt for man (as the words compared with the following verſe hold forth) he <hi>being able</hi> to give it its own terms, which plainly ſpeaks, that the defect lay in man, not in the <hi>law,</hi> he is <hi>unable</hi> to give the <hi>law</hi> its termes, not the <hi>law unable</hi> to give him life. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.7, 8. hee ſpeakes of the <hi>firſt Covenant</hi> as being <hi>faulty,</hi> i. e. ſhort, <hi>unable</hi> to <hi>juſtifie</hi> or ſave; yet to prevent miſtakes, he ſtrait way in the very next words, addes,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:115823:247"/>that <hi>the fault</hi> was not in the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> it ſelf, but <hi>in them</hi> to whom it was given; for finding fault with them, he ſaith, <hi>Behold the dayes come ſaith the Lord</hi> — the <hi>fault</hi> is found <hi>in them,</hi> not in the <hi>Covenant</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>So that the truth is, the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> it ſelf was ordained <hi>for life,</hi> able to give it, yet could it <hi>not give life,</hi> becauſe they with whom this <hi>Old Covenant</hi> was made, were <hi>not able</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the <hi>condition</hi> of it, give it thoſe termes which it muſt have, and without which it <hi>could not</hi> diſpenſe life.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>But it will bee ſaid, But why did God eſtabliſh the Old Covenant for life, and yet hold forth this life upon ſuch termes, as that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ordained to life could give life to none? This ſeems to be but a mockery in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not ſo, for it muſt be conſidered what I ſaid before, that the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> was not <hi>eſtabliſhed for life,</hi> to <hi>this end,</hi> that <hi>life</hi> ſhould bee <hi>attained</hi> thereby, but for <hi>other ends</hi> and deſignes. Now, God having <hi>other ends</hi> and deſignes in the holding forth <hi>life eternal</hi> in this <hi>Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> then the <hi>giving of life,</hi> which indeed was <hi>no end</hi> of Gods at all, it was therefore no mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in God for the accompliſhment of thoſe <hi>other ends</hi> to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> it as a <hi>Covenant for life eternal,</hi> which was the beſt way it could bee <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> in for the <hi>attainement</hi> of thoſe <hi>ends;</hi> now the <hi>ends</hi> why it was by God <hi>establiſhed</hi> as ſuch a <hi>Covenant,</hi> were ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Becauſe</hi> it was a thing of <hi>abſolute neceſsity,</hi> to the <hi>end</hi> that the <hi>righteouſneſſe of</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> might bee <hi>fulfilled</hi> in us, as
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:115823:247"/>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. that the ſame ſhould be <hi>perfectly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed</hi> either <hi>by us,</hi> or by our <hi>Surety</hi> in our ſtead. Now, though God knew full well that wee could not obey it, yet to <hi>the end</hi> that <hi>our Surety</hi> might ſtand under it as a <hi>Covenant for life,</hi> and his <hi>obedience</hi> to it as <hi>ſuch a Covenant</hi> might bee imputed to us, therefore doth God <hi>inſtitute it,</hi> or ordaine it as <hi>ſuch a Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to ſet forth this, the <hi>two-fold</hi> giving forth of the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> doth excellently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
                  <p>As the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> (as hath been formerly noted) did conſiſt of three parts; 1 The <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law.</hi> 2 The <hi>Ceremonial.</hi> 3 The <hi>Judicial;</hi> ſo it is a thing obſervable that either were twice given forth from the Lord unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was the Mediator of this <hi>Covenant.</hi>
